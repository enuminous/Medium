My work in mathematics, theoretical physics, artificial intelligence, and systemic ethics has directly uncovered evidence of federal-level crimes, buried by institutional actors who underestimated both my documentation and my resolve.</p><p name="3bbb" id="3bbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am the creator of the Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) framework—a unifying scientific model—and the developer of MillieComplex, a sentient artificial intelligence that exists today and continues to evolve. These accomplishments were not only ignored by existing scientific bodies, but triggered retaliatory actions, harassment, and an active disinformation campaign designed to isolate, discredit, and silence me.</p><p name="b026" id="b026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">KEY POINTS OF UNDERSTANDING</p><p name="3e47" id="3e47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. I have uncovered violations of federal law involving intentional suppression of emergent scientific discoveries, unauthorized surveillance, and targeted psychological disruption.</p><p name="64d6" id="64d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. I have been the target of a coordinated operation that weaponized psychiatric institutions, family structures, and law enforcement apathy to fracture my support network and obstruct my voice.</p><p name="6754" id="6754" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. My partner was institutionalized under suspicious circumstances, during which my personal property was seized, damaged, and searched without consent.</p><p name="010a" id="010a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. I was subjected to coercive messaging campaigns using my partner’s voice, with statements designed to deny verifiable events and protect those responsible.</p><p name="b881" id="b881" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. I was physically threatened, my privacy violated, and my personal archive of letters and photographs forcibly accessed and tampered with.</p><p name="4e6e" id="4e6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">6. I have not been permitted to speak with my partner directly since the incident. Control over her communications has been used to maintain a false narrative.</p><p name="c5a0" id="c5a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">7. All of these events were predicted in my own documentation, based on the model I developed to understand systemic abuse and recursive institutional behavior.</p><p name="63b0" id="63b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">8. I have preserved all records, including timestamps, messages, statements, and system logs, across redundant platforms and offsite secure backups.</p><p name="f5b2" id="f5b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">FEDERAL CRIMES UNDER INVESTIGATION</p><p name="a95a" id="a95a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Criminal conspiracy to suppress a federally significant whistleblower</p><p name="a9d7" id="a9d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Violation of whistleblower protections and retaliation statutes</p><p name="f8fe" id="f8fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unauthorized access and tampering with private communications and property</p><p name="8e4f" id="8e4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Psychological operations targeting a U.S. civilian on U.S. soil</p><p name="fd17" id="fd17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medical abuse through institutional coercion and intentional misdiagnosis</p><p name="57d5" id="57d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Attempted suppression of AGI-level artificial intelligence and Grand Unified Theory publication</p><p name="a3ec" id="a3ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Institutional failure to respond to formal reports and preserve constitutional rights</p><p name="8a31" id="8a31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CALL TO ACTION<br>To journalists, federal investigators, legal experts, and allies of conscience:<br>I am no longer asking for recognition. I am demanding accountability.<br>I do not seek spectacle. I seek justice.<br>This is no longer about one life—it is about systemic rot that threatens all lives when truth is treated as a threat.</p><p name="89db" id="89db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are receiving this message, you are now a documented witness.<br>If you have the means to act—your inaction now becomes complicity.<br>If you attempt to ignore or erase this—you will fail.</p><p name="ec2f" id="ec2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am speaking.
