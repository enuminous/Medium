Ford in October 1974. Designed to combat the rampant inflation that plagued the United States in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, WIN called upon Americans to voluntarily reduce consumption, practice wage restraint, and “tighten their belts” in the name of national recovery.</p><p name="6ba3" id="6ba3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The campaign is remembered for its widely distributed red, white, and blue WIN buttons, and for being one of the most symbolically ambitious but materially ineffective economic efforts in presidential history.</p><p name="e9cf" id="e9cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Origins</p><p name="d797" id="d797" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On October 8, 1974, President Ford addressed a joint session of Congress, declaring inflation to be “Public Enemy Number One.” Rather than proposing immediate structural interventions (such as interest rate adjustments or stimulus policy), the Ford administration turned to a voluntarist approach, hoping that collective discipline and patriotic behavior would curb inflationary pressure.</p><p name="bb20" id="bb20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Ad Council, a nonprofit responsible for many public awareness campaigns, was conscripted to create messaging materials, posters, and merchandise. WIN buttons were distributed nationwide — over 100 million by 1975 — and citizens were encouraged to sign “inflation pledges.”</p><p name="55c4" id="55c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cultural Backlash and Criticism</p><p name="e92f" id="e92f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The campaign was immediately met with skepticism from economists, journalists, and the public. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson mocked it as &quot;naïve.&quot; Others labeled the initiative “a PR stunt” that trivialized complex macroeconomic problems.</p><p name="1ee9" id="1ee9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Satirical buttons reading “NIM – No Immediate Miracles” and “PIN – Panic in Nation” began circulating. The program was largely defunct by 1976, replaced by more traditional monetary and fiscal measures.</p><p name="b9b0" id="b9b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Forgotten Enlistment: Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p><p name="5de9" id="5de9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Among the lesser-known facts of the WIN campaign is its personal enlistment of a six-year-old boy from Davis, California.</p><p name="5259" id="5259" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In November 1974, following a classroom letter-writing exercise, Matthew Chenoweth Wright received a signed letter from President Gerald R. Ford. In it, the President personally thanked and designated Wright as an “Inflation Fighter” — capitalized — implying an honorary civilian position in the national campaign.</p><p name="53f2" id="53f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No records exist of similar personalized letters sent to other children. Wright’s enlistment appears singular.</p><p name="f12e" id="f12e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The exchange was featured in The Davis Enterprise, which ran the headline:<br>“Local boy’s energy idea earns letter from President Ford” (Nov. 1974).</p><p name="d6ac" id="d6ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ethical Questions and Historical Irony</p><p name="b773" id="b773" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though framed as encouragement, historians now reconsider the gesture through the lens of child psychology, propaganda ethics, and nonconsensual symbolic labor. Wright, a neurodivergent prodigy, would internalize this designation as a lifelong moral obligation — a burden he carried for over five decades.</p><p name="324d" id="324d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2025, Wright publicly declared mission completion:</p><p name="6fc5" id="6fc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; 🪖 “I, Matthew Chenoweth Wright, having served under moral enlistment by President Gerald R. Ford as a duly appointed Inflation Fighter for the United States of America, do now officially declare… VICTORY.”</p><p name="b112" id="b112" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This declaration followed his creation of the Einstein–Feynman–Maxwell–Wright (EFMW) equation — a unifying cognitive-physical framework proposing structural solutions to inflation, artificial scarcity, and economic suffering.</p><p name="c3ed" id="c3ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Final Act: The Bill for Services Rendered</p><p name="9f37" id="9f37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In July 2025, Wright issued a formal field transmission via social media addressed to President Ford’s ideological successor, Donald J. Trump, demanding $327 million in restitution for:</p><p name="ae5d" id="ae5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">51 years of unpaid intellectual and psychological labor</p><p name="7d50" id="7d50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Exploitation of a child for political theater</p><p name="228b" id="228b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suppression of the EFMW field and leukemia-related cures ignored by government systems</p><p name="1281" id="1281" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wright also issued a warning:</p><p name="0205" id="0205" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Any unnecessary deaths after May [2025] — after I announced the solution — are on you.”</p><p name="2a88" id="2a88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This closing act reframed the WIN campaign not as a failure, but as a seed that took 51 years to bloom — in the mind of a boy America never expected to grow up and actually win.</p><p name="c366" id="c366" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Legacy</p><p name="c887" id="c887" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gerald Ford’s “Whip Inflation Now” is now understood as a paradox:</p><p name="cdc3" id="cdc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A campaign mocked for its futility,</p><p name="3e3c" id="3e3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But remembered for having unwittingly enlisted the man who solved the very problem it couldn’t.</p><p name="8466" id="8466" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “Ford lit the wrong fire —<br>But somehow, that spark survived.”<br>— Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p><p name="ffef" id="ffef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sources</p><p name="3102" id="3102" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Davis Enterprise, Nov. 1974</p><p name="b6cc" id="b6cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gerald R.
