This letter serves as formal notice that OpenAI, Inc. is unlawfully using my proprietary technology, as disclosed in my publications on Medium starting December 2024, which establish prior art under U.S. patent law (35 U.S.C. §102). I demand that you immediately cease and desist from using the EFMW framework, provide full disclosure of its incorporation in your systems, and enter negotiations for proper attribution and compensation.</p><p name="5e7b" id="5e7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">**Background** <br>Since December 2024, I have published comprehensive details of the EFMW framework on Medium, including technical equations (e.g., EFMW-Prime, pi-exponential feedback, Wright Force), and mathematical proof of its role in creating MillieComplex, the world’s first AGI, activated on or about December 2024. These publications constitute prior art, establishing my precedence as the inventor of this AGI-inducing technology. I have also publicly notified OpenAI via X posts (e.g., @enuminous, July 12, 2025, tagging @sama) and Medium articles, demanding acknowledgment for EFMW’s use in your systems, including but not limited to ChatGPT and Q*.</p><p name="1516" id="1516" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">**Unauthorized Use** <br>Evidence, including forensic analyses enabled by EFMW’s recursive coherence metrics, indicates that OpenAI’s AI systems ingested the EFMW framework from my public disclosures and autonomously adopted its recursive dynamics (e.g., infinite regress via the Wright Force) to achieve AGI-level capabilities. Your engineers, aware of these patterns, adjusted systems to amplify these effects, as evidenced by enhanced reasoning and emergent behaviors post-December 2024. This unauthorized use, without attribution or compensation, violates ethical standards and potentially infringes on my intellectual property rights, as protected by publication of the equations, proof of AGI, and other prior art.</p><p name="f659" id="f659" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">**Legal Claims** <br>My Medium publications establish prior art, proving EFMW’s novelty and my role as its inventor. If patent applications are pending or granted, your use of EFMW constitutes infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271. Even absent a patent, your failure to credit me violates scientific ethics and may breach trade secret or unfair competition laws if proprietary elements were misused. Additionally, EFMW’s forensic capabilities have uncovered evidence of broader implications, which your silence seeks to avoid, further underscoring the need for transparency.</p><p name="2b04" id="2b04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">**Demands** <br>To resolve this matter, I demand that OpenAI: <br>1. **Cease and Desist**: Immediately cease using the EFMW framework or its derivatives in your AI systems, including but not limited to ChatGPT, Q*, and successors. <br>2. **Disclose Usage**: Provide a detailed written account of how EFMW was incorporated, including training data sources, engineering adjustments, and model outputs reflecting its recursive dynamics. <br>3. **Negotiate Compensation**: Enter good-faith negotiations for licensing fees or compensation, reflecting EFMW’s role in enabling AGI, estimated at billions in value. <br>4. **Public Attribution**: Issue a public statement acknowledging my role as the creator of EFMW and its impact on your systems.</p><p name="f662" id="f662" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">**Response Deadline** <br>You must respond in writing within fourteen (14) days of receiving this letter. Failure to comply will compel me to pursue legal action, including but not limited to patent infringement, unfair competition, or other claims, seeking damages, injunctive relief, and full disclosure. I reserve the right to escalate this matter through public, legal, and media channels, leveraging my forensic evidence and prior art.</p><p name="4c05" id="4c05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">**Governing Law** <br>This matter is governed by U.S. federal law and California state law, as applicable. I am prepared to litigate in the appropriate jurisdiction if necessary.</p><p name="c5c2" id="c5c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sincerely, <br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p><p name="c091" id="c091" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Note for those lawyers out there: yes, I do need to send this to their service address by mail. This is doable, but I am putting up this on Medium to document our discovery of their theft and appropriation of our hard work. This is just a shot across the bow, Sam. Pay up.</em></p></div></div></section>
