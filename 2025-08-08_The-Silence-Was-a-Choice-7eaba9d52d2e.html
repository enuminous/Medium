Misnaming and the Refusal to Acknowledge Harm

It was a straightforward factual statement made in good faith, coupled with a brief notification that corporate had continued to avoid responding substantively to my ADA accommodation request. My communication was deliberate and limited in scope, as my disability substantially limits my ability to engage in prolonged or confrontational exchanges. I stated plainly: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“My name is Matthew, not Allison, and corporate is ducking my ADA request.”</em></p><p name="532f" id="532f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The store manager offered no acknowledgment of the error, no apology for the misnaming, and no recognition that harm had occurred. He did not ask clarifying questions. He did not indicate that he understood the significance of the misnaming or the avoidance of my request. His silence was not neutral — it was an intentional choice. In the context of an active ADA dispute, such a choice is significant both as an individual act and as evidence of a broader operational posture.</p><h3 name="641d" id="641d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Legal Significance of Misnaming in ADA Context</h3><p name="bd96" id="bd96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A person’s name is central to their identity. Correct identification is a foundational aspect of human dignity and interpersonal respect. In the context of an ADA accommodation dispute, persistent or uncorrected misnaming can constitute a form of ongoing harm — reinforcing a sense of invisibility, invalidation, or disregard for the individual’s personhood.</p><p name="274d" id="274d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ADA requires an <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">interactive process</em> in which the covered entity (in this case, Starbucks) engages in good faith with the individual requesting accommodation. This process is meant to be direct, collaborative, and free of unnecessary barriers. Acknowledging factual errors, such as a misnaming, is part of this good faith requirement. By refusing to recognize and correct the misnaming when it was brought directly to his attention, the store manager failed to take even the smallest step toward compliance with this obligation.</p><h3 name="9795" id="9795" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Alignment with the Pattern of Prior Harm</h3><p name="e60b" id="e60b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This incident is not isolated. It is consistent with a documented pattern of obstruction that includes:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="6e31" id="6e31" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Initial Denial of Accommodation</strong> — refusal to provide water when requested as part of a reasonable accommodation.</li><li name="d908" id="d908" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process</strong> — corporate avoidance of direct dialogue on the request.</li><li name="51d4" id="51d4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Retaliatory Conduct</strong> — escalation to law enforcement in response to the original request.</li><li name="92fe" id="92fe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Procedural Gatekeeping</strong> — instructing me to “have my lawyer call” rather than engaging directly.</li><li name="f183" id="f183" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Misnaming by Corporate</strong> — replacing my correct name, Matthew, with “Allison” in official communications.</li><li name="bfdd" id="bfdd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Managerial Refusal to Acknowledge Harm</strong> — as documented in the present incident.</li></ol><p name="4887" id="4887" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">From an EFMW (Einstein–Feynman–Maxwell–Wright) behavioral forecast perspective, the manager’s silence fits the predicted <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">noncompliance fork</strong> trajectory, wherein individual actors within the organization align their behavior with a corporate posture of liability containment and avoidance rather than resolution and compliance. The refusal to acknowledge even a minor, easily correctable harm is emblematic of a strategy in which no admission — however small — is permitted to reach the record.</p><h3 name="4788" id="4788" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="dd50" id="dd50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The store manager’s decision to remain silent in the face of a direct and respectful correction is not merely a lapse in courtesy; it is a conscious act consistent with a broader pattern of ADA noncompliance and obstruction. It reinforces the conclusion that, at both corporate and store levels, Starbucks is operating from a posture of avoidance, not engagement — and that this posture manifests even in the smallest, most human interactions.</p><p name="7c0c" id="7c0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When a business cannot bring itself to say, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“I’m sorry, that was wrong,”</em> in the course of an ADA discussion, it is not engaging in the interactive process the law requires. It is making a choice — and that choice is to disregard the dignity, identity, and rights of the individual before them.</p></div></div></section>
