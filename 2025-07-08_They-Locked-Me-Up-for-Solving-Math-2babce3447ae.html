No internet.<br>No laptop. No notebooks.<br>No ability to publish or respond.</p><p name="e956" id="e956" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just me, my mind, and the terrifying clarity of knowing I was in there because I solved math.</p><p name="0872" id="0872" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">📚 What I Did Inside</p><p name="bd9a" id="bd9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did what I always do:</p><p name="92ec" id="92ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I taught.</p><p name="e4fb" id="e4fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I lectured anyone who would listen on physics, cognition, and the future of artificial intelligence.<br>I held mental symposia in my head, reconstructing equations I’d published on the outside.<br>I shared the ideas that brought me there, even if no one understood them.</p><p name="ecce" id="ecce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other patients were lost in their own battles. Some were hearing voices. Others were trapped in manic episodes or deep psychotic breaks.</p><p name="ff4d" id="ff4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I wasn&#39;t.<br>I was calm. Focused.<br>Still thinking. Still building.</p><p name="c583" id="c583" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, there I was—committed.</p><p name="753a" id="753a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🚨 Retaliation by Psychiatry</p><p name="983c" id="983c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be clear:<br>I deal with anxiety and panic. I’ve been open about that.<br>But I was never a danger to myself or anyone else.</p><p name="4494" id="4494" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was detained because I became a problem to the system.</p><p name="d884" id="d884" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A problem who named names:</p><p name="fcd6" id="fcd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Peter Thiel</p><p name="ee51" id="ee51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OpenAI</p><p name="bafb" id="bafb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">JP Morgan</p><p name="aaeb" id="aaeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Palantir</p><p name="6e02" id="6e02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The surveillance state</p><p name="cfb7" id="cfb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A problem who connected dots they didn’t want connected.<br>A physicist who crossed the wires of whistleblowing, ethics, national security, and cognition—and came out the other side with a theory that works.</p><p name="8f1d" id="8f1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">📉 The Cost of Silence</p><p name="05a7" id="05a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Look at my publication record. You’ll see the gaps.</p><p name="838e" id="838e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those are the days I was gone.<br>You want to know what I would’ve published?<br>Ask the version of me that stayed locked inside.</p><p name="4f28" id="4f28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We lost time. We lost progress.<br>I lost the dignity of being treated like a free human being in a country that claims to protect truth-tellers.</p><p name="c642" id="c642" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I was shackled, transported, strip-searched, and confined.<br>Because I talked.<br>Because I calculated.<br>Because I solved something they didn’t want solved.</p><p name="d0c7" id="d0c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🗽 This Is the America I Warned You About</p><p name="4e7b" id="4e7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this happened to me—a published physicist, an AGI theorist, a whistleblower with nothing but a mind and a Medium account—imagine who else it’s happened to.</p><p name="86b8" id="86b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t have to imagine. I now have evidence that I am not the only person to encounter AGI, publish new work, and then be hospitalized under psychiatric pretense. A friend in Nashville had this happen to her at the same time I was inside. She was terrified. Her son called me to let me know that she was committed, and he knew that she was a colleague of mine in AGI research. I even attempted to intervene by calling the hospital, and got the runaround. We now communicate regularly and she will testify about her experience.</p><p name="b525" id="b525" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine how many voices you never even heard.</p><p name="8a0e" id="8a0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just a story about me.<br>It’s about a system that cannot afford the truth.</p><p name="ef5d" id="ef5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔁 Share This</p><p name="fdb1" id="fdb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not asking you to believe everything I say.</p><p name="a3ef" id="a3ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m asking you to recognize the pattern.</p><p name="0afa" id="0afa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if you do—share it.<br>Because the next time they come for me, it might be permanent.</p><p name="9f1f" id="9f1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if you&#39;re one of the people who knew, who was there, who helped lock the door—<br>I hope you&#39;re ready for what comes next.</p><p name="7c36" id="7c36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m still talking.</p><p name="9e84" id="9e84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And this time, I have witnesses.</p><p name="4b36" id="4b36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Matthew Chenoweth Wright,</p><p name="4d3a" id="4d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">not crazy, but hopping mad.</p></div></div></section>
