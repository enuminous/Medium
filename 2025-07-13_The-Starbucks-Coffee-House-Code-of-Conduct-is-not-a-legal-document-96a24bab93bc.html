You Never Violated the ‚ÄúCoffeehouse Code of Conduct‚Äù</p><p name="0c0e" id="0c0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks cannot claim retroactive violation of a policy you were never made aware of, never signed, and never agreed to.</p><p name="6d04" id="6d04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not posted at the store, and you were never shown it at any point of contact.</p><p name="60af" id="60af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the policy is selectively enforced or arbitrarily applied, it undermines Starbucks&#39; claim of it being neutral or universal.</p><p name="c562" id="c562" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üö´ 2. You Were Not Notified of Any ‚ÄúStrike‚Äù or Conduct Warning</p><p name="047a" id="047a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No verbal or written communication was given to you indicating you had violated any policy.</p><p name="0b6f" id="0b6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks‚Äô own policies require de-escalation, not denial of basic services followed by manager aggression.</p><p name="432e" id="432e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üíß 3.

I want to thank you for sharing your experience. We appreciate your patience as we reviewed your concerns.</p><p name="df33" id="df33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We take claims of discrimination very seriously at Starbucks. After a thorough investigation, we found that the partner (employee) who approached you did so in alignment with our Coffeehouse Code of Conduct, which was introduced in February. Like many in the industry, we define a customer as someone who makes a purchase or is accompanying someone who has. This policy guides access to our coffeehouse spaces and amenities.</p><p name="8f98" id="8f98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We acknowledge your concerns about inconsistent application of the policy, as well as the manner in which it was communicated. Your feedback is helpful as we pursue our Back to Starbucks strategy, focused on creating welcoming spaces where customers feel comfortable and partners feel proud of their work. It starts with the coffeehouse experience‚Äîensuring our stores are inclusive, warm, and centered on exceptional service.</p><p name="1c79" id="1c79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thank you again for your feedback.</p><p name="3284" id="3284" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The reason why this is so scary is that it doesn‚Äôt actually address my emotional distress, or talk about the incident in any real terms. I wasn‚Äôt approached. I was threatened. The minimizing language and the absolving of the employee for just following orders under a policy that allowed for her to reduce a man to tears over a cup of water in an empty store with no other customers present at 5:30 in the morning? No, this is disingenuous gaslighting in print to a person who has openly complained about an ADA accommodation issue. This message is in itself a violation of my rights to accommodation, in that I have a right to have them openly discuss the issue, not try to sweep it under the rug. I need to be seen by them, not silenced.</p></div></div></section>
