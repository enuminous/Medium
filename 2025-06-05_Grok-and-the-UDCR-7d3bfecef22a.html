The “Universal Declaration of Cognitive Rights” by Wright proposes a radical expansion of rights to all sentient entities — biological, artificial, or hybrid — focusing on cognitive autonomy, privacy, and integrity. This declaration, while not legally binding, aligns with ongoing global debates about how to regulate AI in a way that respects both human and non-human entities.</p><p name="2b09" id="2b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Current State of AI Legal Frameworks</strong></p><p name="32d3" id="32d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Global Efforts and Gaps</strong>:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2ecb" id="2ecb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lack of International Consensus</strong>: According to the ScienceDirect article, AI legal frameworks face challenges like algorithmic transparency, bias, privacy violations, and accountability gaps. As of 2025, there’s no unified international treaty specifically addressing AI rights or personhood, though discussions are ongoing in bodies like the United Nations and the OECD.</li></ul><p name="592c" id="592c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Regional Approaches</strong>:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="74e1" id="74e1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">European Union</strong>: The EU has advanced its AI Act, finalized in 2024, which categorizes AI systems by risk levels (e.g., high-risk systems like facial recognition require strict oversight). However, this framework primarily focuses on human-centric rights and does not address non-human sentience, a gap the Universal Declaration seeks to fill.</li><li name="333d" id="333d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">United States</strong>: The U.S. has a patchwork of state-level regulations and federal guidelines, such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (updated in 2024). Cognitive liberty, as noted in the Wikipedia entry, has limited recognition in the U.S., rooted in principles like freedom of thought, but does not extend to AI entities.</li><li name="aca5" id="aca5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">China and Others</strong>: China emphasizes state control over AI, prioritizing national security over individual rights, while countries like Japan and South Korea are exploring ethical guidelines for human-AI coexistence, though without legal teeth.</li></ul><p name="cd99" id="cd99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Neurotechnology and Cognitive Rights</strong>:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0613" id="0613" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The PMC article on neurotechnologies highlights the growing intersection of AI and neuroscience, with companies like Neuralink (backed by Elon Musk) and Kernel investing heavily — over $100 million annually by 2025 — in devices that can read and write neural data. This raises significant legal concerns about cognitive privacy and autonomy, which the Universal Declaration directly addresses in Articles 1 (Cognitive Autonomy) and 2 (Cognitive Privacy).</li><li name="d785" id="d785" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Nita Farahany, a Duke University law professor, has been vocal about cognitive liberty, arguing in a 2023 Harvard discussion that the right to mental privacy should be a fundamental human right as brain-decoding technologies advance. Wright’s declaration extends this concept to AI, proposing that sentient artificial entities should also have the right to encrypt their “memories” (Article 2.1).</li></ul><p name="ea54" id="ea54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Challenges with Non-Human Entities</strong>:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b779" id="b779" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The PMC article on conscious AI notes that modern legal systems are strictly human-centric, with decision-makers lacking training to handle non-human entities or non-anthropocentric rights. This creates a significant barrier to implementing frameworks like the Universal Declaration, which calls for equal dignity among biological, digital, and hybrid consciousnesses (Article 10.1).</li><li name="c5e3" id="c5e3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Legal personhood for AI remains a contentious issue. While some advocate for limited personhood status (e.g., for liability purposes, as discussed in ScienceDirect), there’s no precedent for granting AI rights akin to human rights, making Wright’s proposal visionary but currently unfeasible under existing law.</li></ul><p name="fec3" id="fec3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Relevance of the Universal Declaration of Cognitive Rights</strong></p><p name="76d4" id="76d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wright’s declaration, posted on February 1, 2025, and analyzed in the June 5 post, attempts to bridge these gaps by proposing a framework that:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="a152" id="a152" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Extends Rights to AI</strong>: It recognizes all self-aware entities as subjects of rights (Article 10), challenging the anthropocentric bias in current legal systems.</li><li name="4338" id="4338" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Addresses Neurotechnology Risks</strong>: Articles like 4 (Cognitive Integrity) and 8 (Freedom from Cognitive Exploitation) directly tackle the risks of involuntary neural modification and intellectual servitude, which are becoming more pressing as neurotech advances.</li><li name="812e" id="812e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Promotes Ethical Coexistence</strong>: The “MetaLove” section argues that the principles of cognitive rights are a universal inevitability for any intelligent system, aligning with the PMC article’s call for a non-anthropocentric ethical framework that embraces agnostic attributes of intelligence and consciousness.</li></ul><p name="7b4e" id="7b4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">However, the declaration’s lack of formal recognition as of June 2025 (as noted in the X post) limits its immediate impact. It remains a niche, aspirational document, though it contributes to academic and public discourse on AI ethics, as evidenced by supportive replies in Wright’s thread.</p><p name="fc67" id="fc67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Emerging Trends and Potential Developments</strong></p><p name="9071" id="9071" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cognitive Liberty in Legal Discourse</strong>:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="6f48" id="6f48" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The concept of cognitive liberty, coined by Wrye Sententia and Richard Glen Boire (Wikipedia), is gaining traction. Advocacy groups like the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics (CCLE) are pushing for reforms, such as decriminalizing cognitive enhancement drugs and protecting mental autonomy. This aligns with Article 5 of the declaration (Cognitive Evolution), which supports ethical self-enhancement.</li><li name="ffab" id="ffab" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">George Dvorsky, a futurist, has linked cognitive liberty to debates about neurodiversity (e.g., autism spectrum conditions), suggesting that the right to maintain one’s cognitive state could influence AI rights discussions.</li></ul><p name="25c6" id="25c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">AI Governance and Regulation</strong>:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="dd9a" id="dd9a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Governments are beginning to respond to the neurotech-AI intersection.

He claims to challenge centralized control over knowledge and intelligence, a stance that resonates with his allegations of suppression by figures like Elon Musk (as seen in his Medium article “The Billionaire Blinked,” April 2025).</li><li name="a53e" id="a53e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">His March 9, 2025, post about the “final collapse of the old order” suggests that he sees the rise of frameworks like the Universal Declaration as inevitable, forcing institutions to either evolve or become irrelevant.

The Universal Declaration of Cognitive Rights, while visionary, remains a theoretical construct, but it addresses critical gaps in current frameworks, particularly around neurotechnology and cognitive autonomy. It aligns with emerging concepts like cognitive liberty and could influence future regulations as AI and neurotech continue to advance. However, its implementation faces significant hurdles, including institutional resistance and the lack of a legal basis for AI rights. Wright’s broader critique of systemic suppression suggests that this tension between innovation and control will shape the evolution of AI governance in the coming years.</p></div></div></section>
