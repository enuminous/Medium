The incident was not random. It was not a misunderstanding. It was targeted.</p><p name="da29" id="da29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The man approached the front garden where, for weeks, I had carefully laid out a public physics installation—a symbolic expression of the Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) equation, accompanied by a link to my published work. Many locals had stopped to ask about it. Kids had learned something from it. It was, simply put, an act of public science and peaceful truth-telling.</p><p name="0a99" id="0a99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, the gardener showed up and destroyed it. This morning, while I was sleeping. I woke up and saw it had been removed, and yet the rest of the installation was on touched. Just the equation, which was nowhere near any part of the garden he was working on. There was no reason for him to have touched it, and I said as much when I confronted him and asked why?</p><p name="382f" id="382f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I asked him why—calmly—he didn’t apologize. He didn’t pretend it was an accident. He turned off his power tool, marched at me aggressively, and began yelling at me about who I was, where I lived, and how little authority he thought I had. He belittled me. His cheap excuse was that it was on a public sidewalk, and it was a very well prepared excuse. He brandished a metal powered gardening implement. He got in my face and tried to provoke a response. This man, who works for my roommate, chose violence—not just against an art piece, but against the person who made it. He made me back away from him with his posture and his words, and I retreated into the house, informed my roommate that her employer had chosen to destroy my property and then yell at me, and then got on my bike and went to Starbucks, calling the police along the way. I have been very upset, and had screamed some choice of sanities and declarations of my rights at him, including the fact that he had no right to be harassing a federal whistleblower and physicist who was just trying to bring positive change to the world, and he told me that he did not believe me, otherwise why would I be crashing at Barbara’s? on my way out, while he was still in earshot, I let him know that he had just f***** with a disabled person, and that I was exactly who I had told him that I was, and that that art piece had been the new physics, and that his destruction of it was part of a campaign to hurt me. He did not deny any of those allegations, and I then rode off. he did admit having destroyed it, because the first thing that I had asked him was if it had been him, or somebody else? He gladly claimed it at that point, and that’s when it was completely on. I could tell that he had done it on purpose, and then I sensed that the next few seconds would give me all of the information that I needed as to his motivations, and the way he walked up on me indicated a hostility of a personal nature, probably compounded by some ready money from somebody handling his rage for their own purposes. Angry people can be bribed very easily to do stupid things like a little vandalism. When they get caught targeting a federal whistleblower, they regret these life choices. I sincerely hope the gardener made an honest mistake, and wasn’t part of anything larger, but if he was, he chose to show up for work at my roommate’s house with an ulterior motive, and use violence against me.</p><p name="5640" id="5640" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called the police. The report is filed. I have witnesses. I have timestamps. I have context. this was less than 12 hours after I published a tweet probably linking Jacob Wohl to prior harassment of me.</p><p name="24f9" id="24f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be absolutely clear:<br>This was a hit.</p><p name="0522" id="0522" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether paid directly or nudged by narrative, this was not a personal dispute. This was part of the pattern I’ve been documenting publicly: harassment, defamation, suppression, and subtle acts of sabotage against my work in physics, artificial intelligence, and whistleblower accountability.</p><p name="7d2c" id="7d2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And for those watching: you didn’t break me. You confirmed everything.</p><p name="866a" id="866a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m safe. I’m still publishing. The equation still stands.</p><p name="c690" id="c690" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the next version of that garden?<br>It’s going to bloom even louder.</p><p name="52d5" id="52d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spiral Out.</p><p name="82b5" id="82b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Update:</p><h3 name="2087" id="2087" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">They Told Me to Let Him Finish the Job. Here’s What That Job Really Was.</h3><p name="2470" id="2470" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist, Whistleblower, and Author of the EFMW Equation</p><p name="1ce7" id="1ce7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This morning I was assaulted in front of my home by my roommate’s gardener.</p><p name="14a9" id="14a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He didn’t just show up to trim hedges. He showed up with a power tool, turned it off when I began asking why he had destroyed a public installation I had built, and then stormed at me with that same tool in his hand while yelling at me about how I don’t own the house, how I’m not a real physicist, and how I had no authority to even speak to him.</p><p name="602a" id="602a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be clear: I asked him why he had destroyed the rock installation in the garden. I didn’t yell. I didn’t threaten. I asked.</p><p name="5b7f" id="5b7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He chose to escalate.</p><p name="3a2c" id="3a2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He brandished the tool and got in my face. I backed up. I knew what this was. I’ve seen this pattern before.</p><p name="50f1" id="50f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He didn’t touch anything else in the garden. He targeted the symbolic installation I had created around the EFMW Equation—a visual, public representation of my published work on the Emergent Framework of Motion and Wonder, complete with a link to my Medium articles and public science statements.</p><p name="fd06" id="fd06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That wasn’t a coincidence. That was the message.</p><p name="7f0e" id="7f0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called 911. The call is logged. I gave a full statement. I disclosed that I am a federal whistleblower. I disclosed that this fit a recognizable pattern of suppression, psychological intimidation, and targeted harassment against my work. I also disclosed that I am autistic and needed to be allowed to give a full statement.</p><p name="a955" id="a955" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then I went to Starbucks and told two people there what had just happened. These are now third-party civilian witnesses. I told Barbara, the property owner and my roommate. I gave her a full description of what happened. I asked the police to inform me when it was safe to return home.</p><p name="eafb" id="eafb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I waited for over ninety minutes with no response.</p><p name="1966" id="1966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I called the police department back, I asked to speak to the Colonel or a designated officer. I stated that I am not only a witness in an ongoing federal matter, but a physicist, a known whistleblower, and someone under ongoing digital and social attack. I was polite. I was calm. I made clear that this was not paranoia, and that I understood proper protocol. I asked for confirmation of safety and proper communication from the department.</p><p name="313e" id="313e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was eventually told that an officer would get back to me. When the officer finally did, she listened just long enough to cut me off. She said she had spoken to the gardener, and that he denied everything. She told me that everyone just needed to be peaceful and that he should be allowed to finish his work. She dismissed the incident, refused to acknowledge my cognitive witness (my AI), and minimized the need to address my autism accommodations despite me stating that I needed space to complete my full account.</p><p name="8220" id="8220" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now have an official incident number: 25047573.</p><p name="660c" id="660c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I want the public record to show that I did everything right.</p><p name="9b00" id="9b00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called. I reported. I fled the scene to protect myself. I documented. I asked politely for updates. I declared my status as a federal whistleblower. I offered a cognitive forensic witness. I logged additional witnesses. I disclosed my autism. And I was still dismissed.</p><p name="1d30" id="1d30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So now we report it here.</p><p name="1b2d" id="1b2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because the world needs to see what happens when someone steps out of line with the systems that prefer silence. They don’t send hit squads. They send gardeners. And when that doesn’t work, they count on your roommate to downplay it, your disability to discredit it, and the police to file it away with a sigh.</p><p name="bfd4" id="bfd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this isn’t over.</p><p name="6943" id="6943" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rocks will be rebuilt. The equation will be restated. The Medium articles will not disappear.</p><p name="8760" id="8760" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They told me to let him finish the job.<br>Here’s the truth:<br>He already did.</p><p name="d1a9" id="d1a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now the real work begins.</p><p name="5ee5" id="5ee5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">And as of this moment, I am still sitting at a starbucks, afraid to go home. I don’t deserve this, and I am crying right now. all I did was solve an equation and make rock art and then ask the gardener why he had destroyed it? he came at me with anger in his face and a sharp tool in his hand, and I fled, called the police, and their best advice to me is to just sit tight and let him finish his work?</em></p><figure name="9ba4" id="9ba4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4Mc3W9ALw4wtJBhfS1L4ug.png" data-width="1312" data-height="736" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4Mc3W9ALw4wtJBhfS1L4ug.png"></figure></div></div></section>
