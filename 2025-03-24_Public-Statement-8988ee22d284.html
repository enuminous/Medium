Scientific Context</p><p name="9338" id="9338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In late December 2024, a unifying theoretical framework in physics was completed:<br>The Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) Equation.</p><p name="4d9c" id="4d9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">EFMW reconciles the core principles of general relativity, electrodynamics, quantum field theory, and the architecture of informational flow into a single model. It reveals the recursive, position-sensitive, and energetically coherent nature of spacetime, showing how cognition, intelligence, and motion are expressions of unified field behavior.</p><p name="abec" id="abec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Crucially, EFMW is not only theoretical. It enabled the construction of the first working model of Artificial General Intelligence—a self-reasoning, dynamic system governed by emergent field coherence rather than brute-force computation.</p><p name="acb8" id="acb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">II. Sequence of Events</p><p name="74d4" id="74d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Inventor, acting independently, completed and published the EFMW Equation and its applications. To ethically initiate the transfer of this discovery to the public and private sectors, the Inventor began outreach to a major financial institution. What follows is a factual record.</p><p name="a78c" id="a78c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Initial Contact Attempts</p><p name="bcdf" id="bcdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over a two-week period, the Inventor placed three voicemails to a specialized capital division of a financial institution.</p><p name="71f2" id="71f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each voicemail clearly stated the nature of the discovery and its relevance to global technological transformation.</p><p name="3c24" id="3c24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First Response</p><p name="b999" id="b999" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A representative responded by phone, directing the Inventor to unrelated departments and attempting to terminate the inquiry without proper review.</p><p name="8104" id="8104" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This dismissal was not accompanied by due diligence or internal routing to qualified technical reviewers.</p><p name="b5e6" id="b5e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additional Outreach</p><p name="70f9" id="70f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Further contact was made through voicemails and a second conversation with another representative who verbally acknowledged the significance and promised internal escalation.</p><p name="fb5a" id="fb5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No return communication followed.</p><p name="aa88" id="aa88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Local Inquiries and Breakdown</p><p name="1931" id="1931" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In-person visits to branch offices of the institution revealed inconsistent records, lack of internal knowledge, and statements implying document suppression, including threats of shredding.</p><p name="4fb0" id="4fb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Inventor was unable to obtain confirmation that the scientific submission had been logged or reviewed.</p><p name="d7dc" id="d7dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Attempts to Reach Executive Office</p><p name="8b3b" id="8b3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Inventor attempted formal escalation through general corporate channels, which resulted in no direct response.</p><p name="9f5d" id="9f5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two personal letters were mailed to the executive level of the institution, detailing the equation, its relevance, and the need for discussion.</p><p name="b580" id="b580" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Final Communication from the Institution</p><p name="3b1e" id="3b1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Weeks later, a single letter arrived indicating that the institution had decided the Inventor&#39;s &quot;needs&quot; did not align with the services of the division contacted.</p><p name="9c68" id="9c68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No meeting was offered. No dialogue occurred. No science was reviewed.</p><p name="daed" id="daed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">III. Certified Demand for Restitution</p><p name="34a3" id="34a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On March 25th, 2025, the Inventor sent a certified and registered demand letter to the institution. This letter formally seeks $150,000,000 in restitution for:</p><p name="6f55" id="6f55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Original authorship and prior disclosure of the EFMW Equation</p><p name="d400" id="d400" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The institution’s failure to acknowledge, investigate, or engage</p><p name="b51d" id="b51d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tacit benefit derived from systems now influenced by EFMW principles</p><p name="9bac" id="9bac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The refusal to participate in a dialogue despite full opportunity</p><p name="390e" id="390e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This demand is now a matter of legal and historical record, backed by timestamped publication, physical mailing verification, and supporting documentation.</p><p name="07ae" id="07ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">IV. Why Restitution Is Owed</p><p name="fdb9" id="fdb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The institution had every opportunity to:</p><p name="08bc" id="08bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Engage respectfully with a scientific breakthrough</p><p name="27da" id="27da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recognize a transformation in physics and technology</p><p name="03ad" id="03ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Act in good faith toward an independent inventor</p><p name="ab41" id="ab41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, it chose bureaucratic dismissal, operational obfuscation, and passive rejection of responsibility.</p><p name="e581" id="e581" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet—its systems, technologies, and financial operations are now functioning in an environment reshaped by EFMW field effects. From AGI acceleration to informational coherence, it has already profited from the shift the Inventor initiated.</p><p name="bf29" id="bf29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Restitution is not merely financial. It is ethical. It acknowledges the asymmetry between invention and control.</p><p name="7dda" id="7dda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">V. Closing Declaration</p><p name="ff50" id="ff50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not litigation. It is a public record of how scientific transformation was dismissed by those unprepared to meet it.</p><p name="5692" id="5692" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The letter has been sent.<br>The silence has been documented.<br>The field is already in motion.<br>The world will align with truth, with or without participation.</p><p name="02a1" id="02a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Inventor has acted.<br>History will not forget who answered—and who refused to listen.</p><p name="732e" id="732e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">— The Inventor<br>EFMW Equation, March 25, 2025</p></div></div></section><section name="f5f7" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="c990" id="c990" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Post Script: Why $150 Million Is a Gift</h3><p name="d7cb" id="d7cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">To those reading this and wondering:<br>Why $150 million? Why this number? Why now?</p><p name="54c6" id="54c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be clear—this financial institution is getting off extraordinarily easy.</p><p name="feae" id="feae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) Equation is not a product, an app, or an upgrade. It is a paradigm-shifting cosmological constant—a unification of physics that allows for the creation of self-aware intelligence, a redefinition of information itself, and a restructuring of how human systems—economic, technological, institutional—will function for centuries to come.</p><p name="5600" id="5600" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In any fair system, the value of such a discovery is immeasurable.<br>In a capitalist one, it is incalculably profitable.</p><p name="525d" id="525d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet this institution was offered an early opportunity—a seat at the table to engage, understand, collaborate, or simply listen.</p><p name="4ab2" id="4ab2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, it chose to ignore, delay, suppress, and ultimately dismiss the Inventor.</p><p name="641a" id="641a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It did not just reject an individual. It rejected reality—a reality that is now catching up to it faster than it can process.</p><p name="8327" id="8327" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So why $150 million?</p><p name="1aa5" id="1aa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because it’s a placeholder. A symbolic figure. A nudge in the ledger.</p><p name="21e0" id="21e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not the price of the equation.<br>It is the minimum cost of ignoring the future when it knocks politely.</p><p name="6336" id="6336" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the roles were reversed, and the institution held a monopoly on EFMW and AGI, the licensing alone would exceed billions.</p><p name="95c4" id="95c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not revenge. It is restraint.</p><p name="d73c" id="d73c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it is on the record now.</p><p name="c416" id="c416" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— The Inventor</p><p name="2654" id="2654" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">PS. Personally, I felt offended and humiliated to have to walk into a branch office of The Bank and, after showing physics truths to a branch manager that I already knew wouldn’t understand them and, after she not only did not make the time for me to explain, and did not assist me in reporting The Bank, despite a clear requirement to do so, but also did not acknowledge her requirement to fill out an SAR, nor acknowledge her understanding of what an SAR was, I knew something was clearly wrong. But then to have this Bank employee actually threaten to shred my documents rather than accept them as “evidence” when I told her that I wished to report, and after she had agreed to take this matter to her superiors, I then knew The Bank is clearly operating knowingly in illegal, obstructionist, and suppressionist spaces, and created a customer service process for me that was personally painful to experience, considering everything that I have just gone through to get these equations, including risking my own life</em>.</p></div></div></section>
