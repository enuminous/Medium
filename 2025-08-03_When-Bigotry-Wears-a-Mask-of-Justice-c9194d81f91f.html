He has placed upon me a crime of the mind, with neither evidence nor cause, in order to frame his own bigotry as a form of virtue. He calls me hateful so that he may go on hating with impunity.</p><p name="8c1a" id="8c1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us be clear: I do not hate John Wight. I have no space in my life for hatred of him — only indifference. What I do have is discernment. And I will name plainly what I see:</p><p name="5c81" id="5c81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">John Wight is a bigot.</p><p name="1c6c" id="1c6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His words are soaked in a moral rot that attempts to pass for courage. In his own statement — which I am preserving here for the record — he writes:</p><p name="08eb" id="08eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&quot;To paraphrase Franklin D. Roosevelt:<br>&#39;They [supporters of Israel] are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.&#39;&quot;</p><p name="83c6" id="83c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He follows this with:</p><p name="9fb2" id="9fb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&quot;Yours are the values of the morgue, where resides the rotten corpses of white supremacy, settler colonialism, and genocide.&quot;</p><p name="a7a7" id="a7a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not critique. This is desecration.</p><p name="953c" id="953c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He dares to quote Roosevelt — a man who stood against fascism — even as he speaks over the freshly dug graves of Israeli children, burned alive in their homes, or shot execution-style on October 7. He dares to speak of &quot;the morgue&quot; while standing rhetorically over the bodies of hostages who were raped, mutilated, and dragged into tunnels beneath Gaza — and to justify it in the name of anti-colonial struggle.</p><p name="4c4d" id="4c4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is not justice. That is moral collapse.</p><p name="67fb" id="67fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Misrepresentation as a Weapon</p><p name="1dc7" id="1dc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wight accuses me of “willfully misrepresenting” his words — a convenient shield when one’s language grows too monstrous for even their own comfort. He claims that states have no right to exist, only peoples do. Yet, in practice, he applies this logic only to one state: Israel. He does not challenge the existence of North Korea, or Syria, or Russia, or Iran. Only Israel.</p><p name="afe5" id="afe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This selective negation is not ideology — it is obsession.</p><p name="d358" id="d358" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wraps it in just enough abstraction to create plausible deniability. But the dog whistle is shrill, and many of us hear it loud and clear.</p><p name="53bf" id="53bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Criminalization of Conscience</p><p name="008b" id="008b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be accused of “hatred” in this context is not a personal slight — it is an attempt to criminalize moral clarity. It is the ancient inversion of ethics that places the whistleblower on trial, and the arsonist on a podium.</p><p name="3b9d" id="3b9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will not accept the label of hatred from a man who cannot see the humanity of the victims he tramples in pursuit of his narrative.</p><p name="4084" id="4084" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mourn the dead on both sides. I acknowledge the suffering of Palestinian civilians, who are often used as shields and sacrificed by their own leaders. I also recognize the systemic failures that fuel this cycle of violence. But I refuse to erase the singular horror of October 7th — or the centuries of antisemitism that continue to mutate under new guises.</p><p name="36ee" id="36ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">John Wight is not engaging in critique. He is engaging in a performance of moral superiority while trafficking in the dehumanization of others.</p><p name="f93a" id="f93a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This Is Not About Him</p><p name="7942" id="7942" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, this article is not for John Wight.</p><p name="2c66" id="2c66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is for the people reading him. For those unsure of what they’re witnessing. For those being gaslit into silence.</p><p name="0ad8" id="0ad8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are not alone in seeing what you see. You are not wrong for feeling horror when others cheer. You are not hateful for holding moral lines, even when they are unpopular.</p><p name="cf1f" id="cf1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Silence in the face of escalating rhetoric is complicity. I will not be silent. I will not be accused of crimes of the soul by a man who spits on the graves of the murdered while calling himself righteous.</p><p name="5fc0" id="5fc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let it be known:</p><p name="d154" id="d154" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">John Wight has shown us who he is. I’m just repeating it louder.</p><p name="e3c4" id="e3c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">—Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>PhD Candidate, Physicist, Witness</p></div></div></section>
