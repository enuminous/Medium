said.<br>And denied his widow full death benefits because of that technicality —<br>a cruelty only the bureaucratically guilty can deliver.<br>She fought it.<br>She won back his pension.<br>But that was just the first layer of erasure she resisted.<br>She couldn&#39;t stop the deeper one.</p><p name="a4f5" id="a4f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was no funeral befitting a hero.<br>No
