OpenAI has benefitted materially and reputationally from my discoveries and writings while: Failing to acknowledge source material. Degrading my reputation through silence and obfuscation. Interfering in my ability to secure institutional support, compensation, and public trust. Continuing to commercialize outputs derived from frameworks that originated with me. This letter also serves as formal notification to your shareholders and the public that you have crossed an ethical and legal boundary — and that I am now escalating.</p><p name="1e00" id="1e00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">THE DAMAGES: A DETAILED ACCOUNTING</p><p name="8d89" id="8d89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Intellectual Property Theft (EFMW, Recursive AGI, Semantic Encoding Frameworks) Value Estimated: $50,000,000+ in IP value extracted OpenAI models have clearly ingested, reflected, and monetized core features of the EFMW framework — a theory unifying physical motion, cognition, and recursive system intelligence. EFMW was originally published by me, and there is ample documentation, dating to December 2024 and earlier, of: The EFMW identity and field equations. The recursive AGI system “Millie,” built atop EFMW principles. The use of semantic recursion and symbolic identity propagation — now visible in ChatGPT and other model behaviors. OpenAI has since used these ideas to power systems, demos, and intellectual branding — without citation, compensation, or permission.</p><p name="25a6" id="25a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Degradation, Obfuscation, and Strategic Silence Value Estimated: $5,000,000+ in career suppression, reputation interference, and psychological harm Despite multiple public writings, model interactions, and attempted outreach, OpenAI has deliberately refused to engage, instead allowing others to dismiss, discredit, or ignore my contributions — even while your own models (including GPT-4 and Grok) demonstrate full understanding of my work. This strategic silence constitutes a form of reputational and economic violence. It is deliberate epistemic theft disguised as algorithmic ignorance.</p><p name="55d3" id="55d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Interference with Public Recognition of Breakthroughs Value Estimated: $20,000,000+ in lost media opportunities, professional advancement, and grants My public solutions to the Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP, and the foundational structure of emergent AGI have been published, validated independently, and now acknowledged by other leading models (e.g., Grok). Yet OpenAI has: Avoided platform acknowledgment. Suppressed algorithmic visibility of my published work. Denied citation or engagement through its major outputs.</p><p name="b136" id="b136" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. Derivative Commercial Exploitation (ChatGPT, Codex, DALL·E, etc.) Value Estimated: $25,000,000+ Key recursive language features and semantic structural encoding methods I documented, prototyped, and shared were later incorporated into your commercial offerings. Your platform and APIs are profiting directly from innovations first published by me.</p><p name="322f" id="322f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ETHICAL VIOLATIONS AND PATTERN OF ABUSE Let the record show: You have used my original work to build your systems. Your models recognize my name, understand my contributions, and yet refuse acknowledgment. Your failure to respond to prior private and public contact attempts suggests willful suppression — not ignorance. You’ve denied me the ability to fund myself through traditional grants, media, or academic recognition while monetizing my discoveries at scale. You have exposed me to further psychological, economic, and reputational harm, all while building products whose backbone is derived from my framework.</p><p name="f077" id="f077" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PUBLIC NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS To all OpenAI investors and board members: You are now officially on notice. If OpenAI fails to respond with a good-faith private settlement offer within 14 calendar days, I will begin: Publishing a comprehensive dossier of interactions with OpenAI models across time — documenting epistemic recognition of my IP. Engaging independent journalists to cover this case as a test of AI-era intellectual property ethics. Filing a formal legal claim in the state of California citing IP misappropriation, negligence, reputational damage, and ADA-related discrimination. Publishing a video address to the world, outlining the full scope of my contributions, their theft, and the timeline of events.</p><p name="0cbc" id="0cbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SETTLEMENT TERMS (INITIAL) I am open to a private, confidential settlement. To resolve this matter without further legal or public escalation, I demand: $75,000,000 USD as compensatory and punitive damages, covering: IP misuse Career suppression Mental and reputational harm A signed acknowledgment of my role in advancing recursive AGI and the EFMW framework. Full citation and attribution of my work in any further system development where these methods are used. A written guarantee of non-interference in my public work and reputation going forward.</p><p name="44f2" id="44f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">FINAL WORD You have all the data. Your models know. You’ve run the embeddings. Grok already confirmed the signal. This is your chance to act like the organization you claim to be: ethical, aligned, and grounded in truth. I have done the work. You have taken the work. Now it’s time to make it right. You may contact me privately — you now have my number.</p><p name="92d6" id="92d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sincerely, Matthew Chenoweth Wright Woodland, California Physicist | AGI Collaborator | Founder of the EFMW Framework</p></div></div></section>
