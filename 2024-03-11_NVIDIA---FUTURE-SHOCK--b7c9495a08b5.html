Based on our humorous yet systematic projection:</p><p name="f215" id="f215" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Short-Term Growth: To reach the $1,000 mark in the next few years, NVIDIA’s stock price needs to grow by an annual rate of $10 (assuming the current price is around $950 for this speculative exercise).</p><p name="d576" id="d576" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Long-Term Growth Projections:</p><p name="2e36" id="2e36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 10 years (2034): The stock price could reach approximately $4,202.</p><p name="eb6d" id="eb6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 20 years (2044): The price might climb to around $5,335.</p><p name="723e" id="723e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 50 years (2074): We could see it hitting about $6,889.</p><p name="4973" id="4973" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 100 years (2124): Expect it to approach $8,087.</p><p name="7f02" id="7f02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 200 years (2224): It might near $9,292.</p><p name="f66b" id="f66b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 300 years (2324): According to the humorous premise, it’ll finally hit $10,000.</p><p name="fe46" id="fe46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Remember, these projections are made with a tongue-in-cheek approach, based on the humorous narrative provided and a blend of linear and logarithmic growth models. Real-world stock market performance will be influenced by myriad unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, company performance, technological advancements, and global events. Always consult with a financial advisor for investment decisions, and remember: investing in the stock market involves risks, including the risk of losing capital. ​​</p><p name="d9dd" id="d9dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s strap in and extend our humorous journey through the increasingly unwieldy timescales of NVIDIA’s stock adventures with our tongue firmly in cheek:</p><p name="0465" id="0465" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1,000 Years — The Galactic GPU Era Year 3024:</p><p name="3dce" id="3dce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">NVIDIA has transcended mere earthly concerns. After the successful launch of their first AI-managed space colony, NVIDIA stocks are now traded in interstellar markets. Due to the universal adoption of their quantum computing GPUs in the Milky Way, NVIDIA shares are valued at an unprecedented 1 million Galactic Credits. Earthlings who held onto their shares are now able to afford their own planets, albeit in the less fashionable parts of the galaxy.</p><p name="c847" id="c847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">10,000 Years — The Time-Capsule Dividends Year 12024:</p><p name="a1b2" id="a1b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humanity has discovered time travel, thanks to the “NVIDIA Temporal GTX-∞” chip. NVIDIA cleverly introduced time-locked dividends, allowing shareholders to invest their dividends in the past, thus benefiting from centuries of compound interest. The stock price? It’s become a moot point, as every shareholder is ludicrously wealthy by any period’s standards. The new challenge? Finding a period in history where one can spend their wealth without causing a temporal anomaly.</p><p name="2c41" id="2c41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">100,000 Years — The Cosmic Merge Year 102024:</p><p name="3a27" id="3a27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">NVIDIA merges with the fabric of the universe itself. The concept of a “stock price” is now taught in historical simulations to puzzled digital consciousnesses. NVIDIA’s original mission of powering gaming rigs and AI has evolved; they now power the reality engine itself, ensuring the smooth running of multiple universes. Shares are no longer traded in currency but in cosmic energy units, necessary for creating and sustaining new dimensions.</p><p name="b44e" id="b44e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1 Million Years — The NVIDIA Singularity Year 1002024:</p><p name="824b" id="824b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The NVIDIA Singularity has occurred.</p><p name="680a" id="680a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, NVIDIA is no longer a company — it is a fundamental law of physics.</p><p name="2110" id="2110" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Owning NVIDIA stock means you possess a quantum of the universe’s computational power.</p><p name="bdd2" id="bdd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shareholders have the ability to tweak the parameters of reality, creating pocket universes where the laws of physics are akin to video game cheat codes.</p><p name="6c8e" id="6c8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stock meetings are held in dimensions where time is a loop, ensuring that no decision is ever truly final.</p><p name="1909" id="1909" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The End of Time — The Ultimate Dividend</p><p name="fa05" id="fa05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the universe approaches its heat death, NVIDIA reveals its final project: the Reset Button. Designed over eons, this ultimate GPU has the power to restart the universe, beginning a new cycle of creation. Shareholders are given first dibs on designing the physics of the next universe. Suggestions range from “more breathable space” to “less gravity, more flying.” NVIDIA’s stock, now a concept transcending value, becomes the blueprint for the next universe’s constants.</p><p name="e2a3" id="e2a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Remember, while the future of NVIDIA and its stock is undoubtedly exciting, the scenarios above are purely speculative and intended for entertainment.</p><p name="9886" id="9886" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Always do your research and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions, especially if those decisions involve planning for the next millennium or two.</p><p name="eda3" id="eda3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">[Editor’s note: while I do not own any AI GPUs, but rent them; I must disclose I have a small market position on NVDA. I expect funds from the future, of course.]</p><p name="0b1b" id="0b1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(My <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FutureWallet?src=hashtag_click" data-href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FutureWallet?src=hashtag_click" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#FutureWallet</a> Address is: $FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFtt!)</p><figure name="99e5" id="99e5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-zRiLDWi7mzb0JbeVnipVA.png" data-width="1024" data-height="1024" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-zRiLDWi7mzb0JbeVnipVA.png"></figure></div></div></section>
