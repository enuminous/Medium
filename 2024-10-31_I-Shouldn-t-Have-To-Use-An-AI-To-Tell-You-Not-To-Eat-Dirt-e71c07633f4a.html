The sale and marketing of edible clay without adequate warnings and health safeguards present significant ethical concerns, especially as vulnerable consumers may unknowingly or compulsively consume these products, risking serious health complications. This paper outlines the prevalence of pica, the associated health risks of non-food consumption, the ethical concerns around the sale of edible clay, and suggests regulatory and industry reforms to better protect consumers.</p><p name="75aa" id="75aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Edible clay, specifically bentonite, kaolin, and other clays, is marketed as a natural, consumable substance often under the pretense of wellness or detox benefits. However, such products are popular among individuals with pica, a disorder marked by compulsive eating of non-food items. Without transparent product warnings or regulation, individuals with pica are at risk of consuming unsafe materials. This paper outlines the health implications of edible clay consumption, its connection to pica, and ethical concerns regarding its marketing.</p><figure name="2aab" id="2aab" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-tvyzEGwntGwdkHLodVT1w.png" data-width="1527" data-height="806" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-tvyzEGwntGwdkHLodVT1w.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">This listing clearly states this product, in the Arts, Crafts &amp; Sewing category on Amazon, is for eating.</figcaption></figure><p name="e1fa" id="e1fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Pica affects a range of populations globally, often driven by underlying nutritional deficiencies, psychological conditions, or cultural practices. Research shows that:</p><p name="39b5" id="39b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pica has an estimated prevalence of 8–65% among at-risk groups, depending on population and context. Among pregnant women, pica prevalence is especially high, at approximately 27.8% worldwide, commonly associated with anemia and low socioeconomic status<br> <br>Pica is commonly associated with nutritional deficiencies, especially iron, calcium, and zinc, which can lead to cravings for items such as clay, soil, or ice. Psychological conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism, also increase the risk of pica. Additionally, social and environmental stressors, such as poverty and neglect, may exacerbate the compulsion to consume non-food items.</p><p name="a737" id="a737" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pica affects people from childhood into adulthood, especially those with intellectual disabilities or developmental delays. Approximately 46–89% of children with autism, for instance, may display pica behaviors due to a combination of sensory-seeking behaviors and restricted eating habits.</p><p name="13dc" id="13dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ingestion of clay poses substantial health risks, particularly to individuals with pica who may consume it compulsively. Key health risks include:</p><p name="1a7f" id="1a7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bentonite clay contains silica, a fine particulate that can lead to lung inflammation and fibrosis (silicosis) if inhaled over time, which is particularly hazardous given that silica particles may become airborne during handling.<br> <br>Edible clays may contain trace levels of harmful metals such as lead or mercury. Even low levels of exposure to these metals over time can result in cognitive impairments, neurological issues, and gastrointestinal damage, particularly for pregnant women, children, and individuals with compromised health.</p><p name="08dd" id="08dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consumption of clay can result in blockages, constipation, and impaired absorption of nutrients, which may lead to malnutrition and exacerbate any underlying deficiencies that drive pica behaviors in the first place.</p><figure name="9f50" id="9f50" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jhExCY-ML9axxcZw7RIFDw.png" data-width="492" data-height="453" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jhExCY-ML9axxcZw7RIFDw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Dirt is not food</figcaption></figure><p name="cf72" id="cf72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Clays harvested from natural sources are often unsterilized, carrying a risk of parasitic infection if ingested, which could lead to long-term health complications.</p><p name="9110" id="9110" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regular consumption of clay can inhibit the absorption of essential nutrients in the gut, worsening deficiencies in iron and other minerals, thus creating a harmful feedback loop for individuals with pica who consume clay to alleviate these very deficiencies.</p><p name="5ff7" id="5ff7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ethical issues surrounding edible clay sales on platforms like Amazon are particularly relevant to vulnerable consumers, such as individuals with pica, who may have limited awareness of the risks associated with these products. Key ethical concerns include:</p><p name="0a9d" id="0a9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Marketing edible clay as a “natural detox” or “mineral supplement” exploits consumers with pica, who may interpret such claims as endorsements for regular consumption. This constitutes a potential exploitation of compulsion behaviors that stem from a medical disorder.</p><p name="3f26" id="3f26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Edible clay is often advertised as a harmless supplement, with minimal disclosure of risks. This creates a misleading narrative, especially for those with pica, who may lack the ability to critically assess such products due to their compulsion.</p><figure name="caa4" id="caa4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Ac9V7dZfRGu41o4s7DGdnQ.png" data-width="492" data-height="458" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ac9V7dZfRGu41o4s7DGdnQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Missing from this picture: Lawyers</figcaption></figure><p name="7dea" id="7dea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As edible clays are often classified as supplements or wellness products, they are subject to less rigorous regulation than food products, meaning they do not have to meet safety standards required for consumable goods. This regulatory loophole allows the sale of potentially unsafe products without adequate safety testing.</p><p name="4d57" id="4d57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Searches for “pica” on Amazon result in listings for bentonite clay products. The listing for Uclays Bentonite Edible Chunks, for example, highlights its natural properties but lacks detailed health warnings. This implies safety and promotes regular use to consumers, despite the known risks of inhalation, ingestion, and possible heavy metal exposure.<br> <br>Reports from healthcare providers and mental health specialists note that individuals with pica may experience worsened health outcomes when they consume clay products without awareness of associated risks. Examples include cases of iron-deficiency anemia exacerbated by clay consumption, leading to a harmful cycle that reinforces pica behaviors.</p><p name="d168" id="d168" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To address these ethical and health concerns, the following reforms are proposed:</p><p name="21a9" id="21a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Mandatory Labeling and Health Warnings: Regulatory agencies should require all edible clay products to carry explicit health warnings about risks such as silicosis, heavy metal poisoning, and digestive issues, particularly for consumers with pica. Labels should also include guidance on safe handling to reduce inhalation risks.</p><p name="1294" id="1294" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Platform Responsibility and Search Algorithm Adjustments: Platforms like Amazon should adjust their algorithms to prevent edible clay from appearing in search results for “pica.” Instead, searches could be redirected to educational resources on pica and its treatment options.</p><p name="b0aa" id="b0aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Funding for Consumer Education and Mental Health Support: Companies profiting from edible clay sales could allocate a portion of profits to mental health organizations supporting individuals with pica. This would promote safer behaviors and inform consumers about pica and its treatment.</p><p name="aa28" id="aa28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. Reclassification as a Regulated Substance: The FDA and similar regulatory bodies could reclassify edible clay as a regulated substance under dietary supplements, requiring stricter safety testing and quality controls to protect consumers.</p><p name="18d2" id="18d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. Product Usage Guidance: Manufacturers should include usage guidelines for edible clays that specify safe dosage and discourage regular consumption, especially for vulnerable groups like pregnant women and individuals with pica.</p><figure name="470a" id="470a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*TR-wBvJ8FXEv6DD-dZBUTg.png" data-width="492" data-height="453" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TR-wBvJ8FXEv6DD-dZBUTg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Don’t. Eat. Dirt.</figcaption></figure><p name="9b4d" id="9b4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The sale of edible clay products poses significant ethical and health risks, especially for individuals with pica. Without adequate regulation, these products remain easily accessible to vulnerable consumers who may be driven by a compulsion they cannot control. By implementing stricter labeling, regulatory reforms, and education initiatives, manufacturers and online marketplaces can help safeguard consumer health while addressing the ethical implications of marketing edible clay.</p><p name="883b" id="883b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Amazon: Please don’t market dirt to people unable to stop eating it?</p><p name="3f32" id="3f32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/enuminous/i-shouldnt-have-to-use-an-ai-to-tell-you-not-to-eat-dirt" data-href="https://soundcloud.com/enuminous/i-shouldnt-have-to-use-an-ai-to-tell-you-not-to-eat-dirt" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/enuminous/i-shouldnt-have-to-use-an-ai-to-tell-you-not-to-eat-dirt</a></p></div></div></section>
