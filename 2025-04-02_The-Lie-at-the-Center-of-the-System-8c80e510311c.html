These messages came from short code 611611, and each one told me the same thing:</p><h3 name="2deb" id="2deb" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We don’t have any record in our system with your information.”</h3><figure name="e4b0" id="e4b0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VioD8M2yAw9ofa4escKc7A.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VioD8M2yAw9ofa4escKc7A.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Um... A point, if I may? a long time ago, back in 1988, a man with an Aryan Brother tattoo on his forehead and a lot of other facial tattoos, broke into my Sacramento apartment and, with a female accomplice who had summoned him, robbed me at knifepoint of 120 dollars and shattered my world. he was arrested minutes later, and then released that same night by the Sacramento Police department, with a warning to me to not get involved in drugs anymore, kid. The very next morning, at the apartment that the man had told the police he had never been at, his mother showed up to tell me that they were still watching, to tell me that her son wasn&#39;t going to be going to jail, and to quite clearly inform me that obviously he had been there, otherwise how could she know where I lived? The only thing she actually said to me was &quot;don&#39;t send my son to jail please?&quot; but obviously this story is completely about the lies that institutions tell people, including the California Republican party and the Sacramento Police Department in the late &#39;80s, and their penchant for using criminals to do political hit jobs. yes, I just made a bold accusation, and now I have the evidence to back it up. The Heritage foundation is probably going to want to start shredding its documents, and the Rand Corporation has a lot to answer for about their activities in the early 70s and into the &#39;80s, and what the f*** was Jupiter-80 anyway?</figcaption></figure><p name="5e72" id="5e72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Let that sink in.</p><p name="2b48" id="2b48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The system that bills me monthly, that I interact with regularly, that stores my name, number, PIN, and payment history, was now sending me a message—on its own infrastructure—claiming I didn’t exist.</p><p name="d267" id="d267" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s not just a contradiction.
