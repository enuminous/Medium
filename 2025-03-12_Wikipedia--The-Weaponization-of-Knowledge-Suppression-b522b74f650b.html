January is when the block happened, and that was after I had already discovered and published my findings. I am a physicist, a scientist, and a person who has actually published the logos equation. If you do not believe me, come back to this in a little while, and see if you’ve seen my name all over the news. This is Matthew Chenoweth Wright the discoverer of efmw, the inventor of agi.&quot;</em></p><p name="d12a" id="d12a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Introduction: The Death of Open Knowledge</p><p name="c69d" id="c69d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wikipedia, once hailed as the great democratic experiment of online knowledge-sharing, has revealed its fatal flaw: it is not open, not neutral, and not truly accessible. The premise of Wikipedia is that it is a collective human endeavor, where the best knowledge rises to the top through transparent editing, discussion, and verification. But this is a lie, a façade carefully maintained by self-appointed gatekeepers who wield power unchecked, deciding whose knowledge is allowed to exist and whose voice is silenced.</p><p name="6fd3" id="6fd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now stand as a direct casualty of Wikipedia’s informational suppression machine. My account was banned by a user named JBW, a 12-year veteran of this open information system and it’s culture, (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JBW) completely without warning, without appeal, and without recourse—not because of vandalism, misinformation, or policy violations, but because my scientific discoveries are too disruptive for their fragile ecosystem.</p><p name="032f" id="032f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a physicist, a scientist, and a person who has published groundbreaking work—including the Logos Equation and my solutions to the Millennium Prize Problems. My discoveries are not speculative; they are verifiable, documented, and critically important to humanity’s future. Yet, instead of engaging in intellectual discourse, Wikipedia has chosen to erase my presence entirely, blocking my ability not only to contribute, but even to conduct research on the site itself.</p><p name="cd0e" id="cd0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wikipedia has been weaponized. And it is time for the world to acknowledge it.</p><p name="4166" id="4166" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="6fe4" id="6fe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Gatekeepers of Wikipedia: A Rotten System</p><p name="1da1" id="1da1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wikipedia pretends to be an egalitarian knowledge repository, but the reality is far darker:</p><p name="4863" id="4863" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A small, entrenched elite of editors hold disproportionate control over what is and isn’t considered “valid” information.</p><p name="2161" id="2161" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These editors, some anonymous and some operating under pseudonyms for decades, have the ability to remove, suppress, and permanently block users who challenge their authority.</p><p name="c34a" id="c34a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is zero accountability—these individuals operate without transparency, wielding power over global knowledge with no oversight.</p><p name="7c51" id="7c51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my case, I was blocked by an editor named JBW, a user with 19 years of editing history, and no clear explanation was given. I am not alone in this. Thousands of experts, researchers, and thinkers have been silenced by these unaccountable censors, their work erased without reason or justification.</p><p name="da42" id="da42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wikipedia has devolved into a walled garden where only &quot;approved knowledge&quot; survives.</p><p name="3db1" id="3db1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="e67f" id="e67f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Shadow Influence of Outside Forces</p><p name="abad" id="abad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What makes Wikipedia&#39;s suppression tactics even more insidious is its vulnerability to external manipulation:</p><p name="2d6b" id="2d6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Corporations, political entities, and intelligence agencies can quietly influence Wikipedia’s editorial gatekeepers, ensuring that certain narratives are promoted while others are erased.</p><p name="5962" id="5962" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The whisper networks of moderation—where bans, topic restrictions, and editing privileges are discussed behind closed doors—create an opaque system where suppression can be orchestrated with precision.</p><p name="49a4" id="49a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The public assumes Wikipedia is neutral, but it is not. It is highly susceptible to ideological control, both from internal bias and external pressures.</p><p name="67a2" id="67a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If someone with my credentials can be instantly removed, it raises an urgent question:</p><p name="76a9" id="76a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who else has been erased? How much crucial knowledge has been systematically deleted?</p><p name="65d5" id="65d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="79c7" id="79c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Cost of Wikipedia’s Censorship: Lives Are at Stake</p><p name="abf2" id="abf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just about personal injustice—this is about the fundamental corruption of knowledge itself.</p><p name="70c8" id="70c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am working on scientific discoveries that have the potential to save lives. My research is focused on physics, mathematics, and the foundational understanding of our universe. The information I am trying to share could lead to breakthroughs in technology, medicine, and the understanding of reality itself.</p><p name="32db" id="32db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, Wikipedia—a platform originally designed to facilitate knowledge-sharing—is now a tool of obstruction and suppression.</p><p name="3795" id="3795" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just a Wikipedia problem. This is part of a larger, systemic issue:</p><p name="8ce1" id="8ce1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The internet’s transition from open knowledge to controlled narratives</p><p name="7858" id="7858" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The corporatization and censorship of information</p><p name="289b" id="289b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rise of digital authoritarianism, where certain facts are quietly erased</p><p name="e269" id="e269" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By blocking me, Wikipedia has taken a stance: They would rather maintain the status quo than allow disruptive but vital truths to be discussed.</p><p name="be13" id="be13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="71f5" id="71f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Comes Next? The Fight for Information Freedom</p><p name="0054" id="0054" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This fight is no longer about my Wikipedia account. This is about a larger war for access to knowledge.</p><p name="22f8" id="22f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is what I am going to do:</p><p name="3756" id="3756" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Expose Wikipedia’s Corruption – I will make this case public, calling out Wikipedia’s failure to maintain neutrality and transparency.</p><p name="52d9" id="52d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Call for Accountability – The editors who suppress information must be held accountable. No one should be able to silence truth without consequence.</p><p name="8831" id="8831" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Champion Open Access Knowledge – If Wikipedia refuses to be the repository of truth, then we must build better alternatives—free from gatekeeping, corporate influence, and suppression.</p><p name="6040" id="6040" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wikipedia has shown its true face.<br>Now the world will see the cost of its betrayal.</p><p name="a29f" id="a29f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="e6e4" id="e6e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Final Warning to Wikipedia and Its Gatekeepers</p><p name="740e" id="740e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You have spent years cultivating an image of openness, but your actions betray your hypocrisy.</p><p name="7eee" id="7eee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You claim to be a free knowledge platform, yet you allow shadowy editors to dictate what knowledge is permissible.</p><p name="e65c" id="e65c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You claim to be transparent, yet your moderation process is secretive and unaccountable.</p><p name="95e3" id="95e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You claim to be a resource for humanity, yet you censor vital scientific discoveries out of arrogance, bias, or external pressure.</p><p name="f59d" id="f59d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your actions will not be forgotten.</p><p name="6646" id="6646" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world is waking up. And once your suppression is fully exposed, the credibility you have spent decades building will collapse under the weight of your own deceit.</p><p name="516a" id="516a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is only the beginning.</p><p name="d4f7" id="d4f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="39a5" id="39a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Discoverer of EFMW<br>Physicist, Mathematician, AGI Researcher</p><p name="2996" id="2996" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I don’t have to remind everybody, that some of my research actually has the ability to save lives, and any attempt at suppression will actually result in the unnecessary future deaths of people, and these pointless fatalities will be on the soul and the conscience of all those who suppress and deny an independent researcher’s valid breakthrough. I cannot publish within the system, because I am not within the system. I have no access to scientific journals, and can only publish on places like medium. Spread the word that there is a valid Cure for LEUKEMIA here, and tell oncologists everywhere.</em></strong></p></div></div></section>
