I am quoting it here as an introduction to a much larger theme, and I do not echo the sentiments contained in this quotation, which was pulled from¬†Twitter:</h3><p name="2383" id="2383" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">666 TEMPLAR MELCHIZEDEK SEAL Using an innovative method of breaching the separation between the 3rd dimension of the 15 level Gaia time matrix through turnstile stargates, invaders broke into the 4th dimension and attacked the people there in an effort to further disrupt the manifestation simulation platform. Their assault proved futile and they were repelled back into the lower dimension, but this demonstrated to the creators of the Human Elohim there needed to be better security measures taken to protect the rest of the time matrix. The answer was to arrange for ‚Äòseals‚Äô to be placed on the axiatonal DNA strands of the offending beings that would prevent them from manifesting inside any higher in the time matrix, even if they breach the stargate network again. These would be called Templar-Axion Seals. The process they had used to trick the mechanical ascension gates was ingenious. When someone would travel through a gate, when they come out on the other side, their skin is covered in a fine layer of light blue powder. This powder which was explained to me by the Keeper, is ultra-high frequency Carbon 7, an element that is not existent in the 3rd dimension, but gives one the power of ‚Äòcreation‚Äô (as well as the power of ‚Äòascension‚Äô too apparently). The invaders would lay in wait next to stargates, jumping those visiting from a higher dimension, kill them then scrape the precious powder off. How they used it then to trick the gates wasn‚Äôt explained, but it was their ticket to attempt their coup. [I mention this blue powder in another article: üëâ HANDBAGS OF THE GODS if you would like more on that subject.] The Templar Axion-Seal was first authored by the Axious Family and the Ra Confederacy 848,000 years ago, during the Treaty of El-Annu, an agreement between the Oraphim Elohim and Jehovah Anunnaki that was meant to put an end to the Thousand Years War raging at the time, by offering to create a new human/Anunnaki hybrid race in return for the Nephilim giants being relocated off-planet to allow the far smaller humans to evolve without the constant threat posed by such monstrous-sized beings. All these new hybrids would have to agree to abide by the Law of ONE in order to meet the requirements of the Co-Evolution BioRegenesis Treaty of Palaidor. The Leviathan Drakonian hybrids would also all have to receive the Axion Seal, since they all flatly refused the Co-Evolution Treaty that offered the invading beings a method of ascension out of the time matrix where they were uninvited guests and therefore were not coded genetically to ever actually ascend all the way back out. The Leviathans were happy where they were, wreaking havoc over the human slaves. The Treaty was struck and the new hybrid race would be brought into the 3rd Seeding of the Human Elohim tribe known as the Melchizedek Cloister. The new Melchizedek/Anunnaki race would be called the Annu, but later would be renamed ‚ÄòHebrews‚Äô in honor of the Hibiru host of their seeding that would blend the DNA of the Anunnaki with the pure Melchizedek race of the 6th Cloister Human Elohim lineage. This would not be the last time the creators of the Human Elohim would need to resort to placing Templar Seals onto various beings within the time matrix. JThe Templar Melchizedek Seal of 8,000 B.C. was a 7th-dimensional axiatonal-field DNA seal that would block any of the Melchizedek/Anunnaki/Nephilim bloodline, whom are called J3ws today, from ascending any higher than the 6th dimension, preventing them from ever receiving their 7th level bodies until they had incarnated many more times back to the lower dimensions to clean up the distortions they had placed here as well as in the 4th dimension while succumbing to the Anunnaki influences. Later, 3,500 years ago (1500 BC), 2 additional seals would be added to the ‚ÄòHebrews‚Äô for further violations of Co-Evolution Treaty rules. This trinity of blocked seals involved the removal of the 6th base tone of the 1st DNA strand, the 6th base tone of the 5th strand and the 6th base tone of the 6th DNA strand. Together, these 3 disconnections were known as Templar-Axion Seals or the ‚Äú666‚Äù mark that would prevent them rising to the 7th dimension or higher. Since the Templar-Axion Seals are genetic, meaning they are passed on through blood, any other races interbreeding with them would automatically pick up this ‚Äúmark‚Äù. Only those carrying these seals who had finally learned to fully embrace and exemplify the Law of ONE while incarnate in this dimension would ever be granted ascension. Only the Elohim (those still under the Emerald Covenant), the Breanoua entities from the 13th level and higher, the Axious Family, and the Ra Confederacy have the power to release these seals. So for all Melchizedeks bearing the ‚Äòmark of the beast‚Äô which has shown itself as the true anti-Krystos (antichrist) agenda, there will be a review of their life before moving forward. Disclosure of the review process was released in the film Defending Your Life, albeit in a comical fashion to discredit the reality that all Hyksos Anunnaki hybrids from the Adam &amp; Eve creation in E-Den will be required to have their lives reviewed in front of a judgement panel to show they aren‚Äôt just claiming to have embraced more civilized treatment of their fellowman. Human Elohim who have never taken on the Templar-Axion Seals in their genetic blueprints have no such screening process to face.
