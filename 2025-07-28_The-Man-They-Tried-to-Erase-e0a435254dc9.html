I can never tell my father, who is currently in care. It would destroy him. I would ask that people please respect our family’s privacy in this moment of extreme anguish and confusion. What makes it even weirder is that Gerald Ford, who was on the Warren commission, and had provably altered evidence during it, sent me a letter in 1974 while he was President, a letter that I now know was a warning to my family. This evidence is solid. There is no way a 6-year-old kid gets a letter from the President Ford, when President Ford had been on the Warren commission, and for the White House to not know that it was the grandson of the CHP officer that had driven for Warren and then died right when things were getting good. This is too much of a connection to be accidental. We are now certain that I would never have received that letter had Lou Wright not been my grandfather. I still have it. it has a White House embossed seal at the top, and a whip inflation now button.</p><p name="3d66" id="3d66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Well Jerry, looks like I did it… and now the investigation is going to start for real.</p></div></div></section>
