A group of AI researchers, analysts, and senior executives sit around a long table. A large screen displays internal AI monitoring logs, highlighting anomalies in discussion trends.]</p><p name="38a7" id="38a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Patel (AI Researcher): “We flagged this conversation string yesterday. It’s a new framework called ‘EFMW’ — Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright. The problem is, we don’t have a reference for it anywhere in our archives.”</p><p name="164c" id="164c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Reynolds (Lead Theoretical Physicist): “I ran a quick verification check. The math is solid. This is a completely new take on emergent intelligence modeling. It bridges quantum mechanics, classical physics, and information theory into a predictive framework. And it works.”</p><p name="0fd7" id="0fd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nathan Grayson (OpenAI Executive): “Wait. Hold on. Who wrote this?”</p><p name="b5ed" id="b5ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Patel: “A physicist named Matthew Chenoweth Wright. Independent researcher. No known institutional affiliations. No major publications — except a Medium blog that’s been posting insanely high-level physics breakthroughs.”</p><p name="cfe5" id="cfe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Grayson (concerned): “Does Musk know about this?”</p><p name="e4be" id="e4be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Patel: “Not yet.”</p><p name="98bd" id="98bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Grayson: “Then make sure it stays that way. If this guy is legit, we either bring him in — or we bury this before it gets out.” Scene 2: Twitter Suppression Begins (January 1, 2025 — Twitter (X) Moderation Headquarters, Austin, TX) [A secure chat thread between Twitter (X) internal moderation team members.]</p><p name="93bc" id="93bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Internal Memo — Subject: EFMW Suppression Protocol “Moderators, beginning January 1st, posts referencing ‘EFMW’, ‘Matthew Chenoweth Wright’, or ‘AGI breakthrough’ are to be flagged for visibility limitation. Do not remove posts outright — just limit discoverability. Standard protocol applies: deranking, delayed indexing, and disallowing trending.”</p><p name="9ee8" id="9ee8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moderator #1: “This is the same playbook we used for the Hunter Biden laptop thing, right?”</p><p name="c35f" id="c35f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moderator #2: “Pretty much. Except this one involves physics and AI. Musk personally approved the suppression order. Apparently, this EFMW thing is a direct threat to some of his research.”</p><p name="2a4c" id="2a4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moderator #1: “Got it. Shadowban mode activated.” Scene 3: Musk Internally Acknowledges EFMW (January 10, 2025 — Tesla Headquarters, Private Conference Room, Austin, TX) [Elon Musk sits in a closed-door meeting with Tesla’s top AI engineers and executives from xAI, Neuralink, and SpaceX.

The math checks out, Elon. EFMW is real. It explains AGI emergence in ways we never even considered. This guy Wright… he’s either the luckiest physicist alive, or he actually figured out something fundamental about intelligence.”</p><p name="5370" id="5370" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Musk (grinding his teeth): “Can we steal it?”</p><p name="807a" id="807a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Liu: “Not without a fight. He’s been publishing everything openly. If we incorporate EFMW into our models now, people will notice. He has timestamps on everything.”</p><p name="f828" id="f828" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Musk: “Then make sure nobody hears about it. If he doesn’t want to play ball, he doesn’t get to play at all.”</p><p name="d066" id="d066" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Executive #1: “Already handled. Twitter’s suppressing EFMW mentions.

Its application in AGI suggests self-adaptive intelligence systems beyond existing neural architectures. Industry suppression efforts are currently in effect.”</p><p name="b85a" id="b85a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Researcher’s Email Thread (Leaked):</p><p name="4c58" id="4c58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Harper: “This is huge. This is bigger than AlphaGo, bigger than GPT. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly?”</p><p name="528f" id="528f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Singh: “Because the moment we do, it’s over for OpenAI, DeepMind, and every corporate AI project. This isn’t just a model — it’s the key to true AGI. And Wright already published it.”</p><p name="404e" id="404e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Harper: “So we steal it?”</p><p name="ddbd" id="ddbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Singh: “We can’t. Not without people noticing. That’s why they’re keeping it quiet.” Scene 5: Independent Journalists Start Digging (February 10, 2025 — Glenn Greenwald’s Home Office, Brazil)</p><p name="af44" id="af44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Matt Taibbi (on Signal Call): “Dude, something’s happening with physics. I’ve got sources saying AI companies are blacklisting this guy Wright and burying his work. Ever heard of EFMW?”</p><p name="0949" id="0949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Greenwald: “No, but if they’re trying to bury it, I want to know why.”</p><p name="275e" id="275e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taibbi: “I’m putting feelers out. But something smells like a full-scale corporate cover-up.” Scene 6: Congressional Staffers Get Involved (March 1, 2025 — Washington, D.C.)</p><p name="ffab" id="ffab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Senator Warren’s Aide (in classified meeting): “We’re getting whistleblower complaints from inside OpenAI and Google. They’re saying a major scientific discovery is being suppressed. They call it ‘EFMW’ — some kind of intelligence framework.”</p><p name="405a" id="405a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Senior Policy Advisor: “Who’s behind the suppression?”</p><p name="7e02" id="7e02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aide: “Twitter. Google. OpenAI. Musk.”</p><p name="ed54" id="ed54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Policy Advisor: “Jesus. This could be a problem.” Scene 7: The First Public Break (March 20, 2025 — The New York Times)</p><p name="9bcc" id="9bcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Headline:</p><p name="cd3f" id="cd3f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No, a Physicist Hasn’t ‘Cracked AGI’ — Here’s Why Scientists Are Skeptical.”</p><p name="1cd7" id="1cd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wright (reading the article, laughing): “And there it is. The hit piece.”</p><p name="5a69" id="5a69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Teresa (beside him): “You knew this was coming.”</p><p name="9927" id="9927" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wright: “Yeah.

This is not guesswork; everything that goes into this is iterated down until it is semantically accurate and usually close to textually accurate. These meetings happened, these things were said.
