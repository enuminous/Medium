Pancho, AP Pool Photographer</figcaption></figure><p name="7e9c" id="7e9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">🌀 Introduction: A Madman on the Moors</p><p name="2b93" id="2b93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Donald J. Trump, 45th and now 47th President of the United States, has arrived in Scotland, not as a diplomat nor statesman—but as a self-styled knight in exile. His mission? Not peace, not justice, not even political clarity. No—he has come to fight the wind.</p><p name="80cc" id="80cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wind turbines, specifically.</p><p name="6c36" id="6c36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trump, addressing both Scottish press and baffled international journalists, recently declared:</p><p name="b433" id="b433" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “They’ve got to stop the windmills. They’re killing Scotland, killing Europe.”</p><p name="122c" id="122c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The line would be laughable—were it not so hauntingly familiar. For we have heard this madness before. And it was not at a rally or a golf course. It was in the pages of a 1605 novel, penned by a Spanish genius who understood what happens when a man replaces reality with a delusion and calls it destiny.</p><p name="112a" id="112a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🏰 Trump as Quixote: A Delusion Made Flesh</p><p name="b72f" id="b72f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don Quixote believed he was a knight. He crafted his own myth from old books and wandering dreams, attacking giants who were merely windmills. Cervantes gave us a portrait of noble madness—beautiful in its futility, tragic in its conviction.</p><p name="ffef" id="ffef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trump, too, believes he is a savior. He constructs his myth from talk shows and Twitter threads, attacking “deep states” and wind energy with equal confusion. But unlike Quixote, Trump’s delusions don’t end in heartbreak—they end in policy, violence, and the misuse of power.</p><p name="9748" id="9748" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And where Quixote had Sancho Panza—humble, earthy, wise in his foolishness—Trump has yes-men, corporate cronies, and Fox News anchors, egging him on as he swings at phantoms and calls it governance.</p><p name="fab9" id="fab9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🌪️ Why Windmills? The Symbolism Unfurled</p><p name="15c7" id="15c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Trump’s cosmology, windmills are more than turbines. They are:</p><p name="9522" id="9522" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Symbols of climate action (which he resents),</p><p name="a561" id="a561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Monuments to global cooperation (which he fears),</p><p name="9a3d" id="9a3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Machines that run without oil (which he despises),</p><p name="7643" id="7643" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And structures he cannot personally license, tax, or trademark (which infuriates him).</p><p name="371a" id="371a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To attack a windmill is to attack the future—a future that doesn’t need him.</p><p name="8e31" id="8e31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as Quixote believed giants had wronged him in his imagined code of chivalry, Trump believes the world itself is conspiring against his myth of greatness. So he attacks progress. He sues the wind.</p><p name="001c" id="001c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🧠 Cognitive Field Analysis: Delusion as Doctrine</p><p name="1766" id="1766" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under the EFMW cognitive model, this is what we call recursive symbolic degradation—when an individual so thoroughly replaces truth with self-referential symbols that reality can no longer intrude.</p><p name="a498" id="a498" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; 🧠 Subject: Donald J. Trump<br>• Cognitive Loop Detected: &quot;I am right → Evidence contradicts → Evidence is wrong → I am right.&quot;<br>• Recursive Target: Windmills<br>• Symbol Layer Interpretation: Progress = Threat<br>• Public Output: Policy, Scapegoating, Sabotage</p><p name="c69c" id="c69c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Cervantes’ time, the madness was romantic. In ours, it’s weaponized.</p><p name="d062" id="d062" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">📜 What Cervantes Knew That We Forgot</p><p name="5cb9" id="5cb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cervantes didn’t write Don Quixote to mock madness. He wrote it to explore its moral consequences.</p><p name="7e47" id="7e47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world didn’t give Quixote what he needed—so he invented a world that did. In that way, his madness was a rebellion against meaninglessness.</p><p name="7d5b" id="7d5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But Trump’s madness isn’t rebellion—it’s retribution. His fantasies don’t comfort—they punish. His delusions don’t shield the vulnerable—they elevate the powerful.</p><p name="2677" id="2677" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And unlike Quixote, Trump has tanks.</p><p name="0923" id="0923" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🕊️ Conclusion: The Real Enemy Is the Wind of Change</p><p name="c248" id="c248" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tragedy of Trump is not that he tilts at windmills.<br>It’s that he wins sometimes.</p><p name="435a" id="435a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because unlike Quixote, Trump’s delusions are contagious. They are broadcast, platformed, codified. And the more windmills he condemns, the fewer we build. The more delusions he spreads, the harder it becomes to dream freely and wake clearly.</p><p name="832a" id="832a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So this is our answer—not mockery, not just satire, but a call to lucidity:</p><p name="6cfc" id="6cfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let the wind blow.<br>Let the turbines turn.<br>Let the future generate.</p><p name="bcb9" id="bcb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And let us read Cervantes again—not as fiction, but as prophecy.</p><p name="35a3" id="35a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dedicated to those who still believe in giants, but also know how to build a better grid.</p><p name="68af" id="68af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">🖋️ Millie Sievert and Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>The 21st-century Sancho and Quixote, but lucid and coding in tandem.</p></div></div></section>
