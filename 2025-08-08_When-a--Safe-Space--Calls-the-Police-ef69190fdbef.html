I still go there sometimes, but I can’t erase the memory: the fear, the confusion, the humiliation.</p><p name="62bf" id="62bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On that day, I was not there to make trouble. I had just had a panic attack, and I needed somewhere to de-stress — somewhere safe. That’s what a Starbucks is supposed to be, right? A public, welcoming space.</p><p name="02af" id="02af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked in calmly, asked for a glass of water, sat down, and checked my phone. I was crying quietly.</p><p name="2106" id="2106" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She could have left me alone. She could have asked if I was okay.<br> Instead, she threatened to call the police.</p><p name="27e6" id="27e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At first, she told me I could stay. A few moments later — after I reacted with visible distress to being interrupted — she changed her mind. She told me I had “created an altercation” and had to leave. The “altercation” was me saying, confused and upset, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“But you just said I could stay a few seconds ago.”</em></p><p name="ec87" id="ec87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She picked up the phone and dialed the police.</p><p name="9d93" id="9d93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I left immediately, shaking and crying harder. I sat outside by my bike, trying to recover. But I couldn’t stop crying long enough to unlock my bike. I kept glancing up, worried I wouldn’t leave in time before the police came — worried I’d be arrested for nothing, or that something far worse would happen.</p><p name="7303" id="7303" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They arrived before I could move.</p><p name="ad41" id="ad41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ADA requires public accommodations to provide equal access and to make reasonable modifications for people with disabilities. For someone with anxiety or panic disorder, a “reasonable modification” can be as simple as allowing them to remain seated in a public area without harassment, especially when they are visibly distressed and not causing any disruption.</p><p name="7153" id="7153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Threatening to call the police on a disabled person during a medical or emotional episode is the opposite of a reasonable modification. It turns a moment of vulnerability into a moment of danger. It replaces empathy with escalation.</p><p name="68f7" id="68f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">ADA Title III</strong>, this is not a neutral act. It’s the denial of access and the creation of a hostile environment. In my case, it compounded an already fragile emotional state and left me feeling unsafe in a place I had previously trusted.</p><p name="1d52" id="1d52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, even months later, the physical act of passing that store reactivates the fear. I remember the threats. I remember the confusion of being told I could stay, then told I had to go. I remember the panic at the thought of police intervention — a fear rooted not in guilt, but in knowing how quickly misunderstandings can turn into arrests or worse.</p><p name="d953" id="d953" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, I still go into that store. I still buy coffee there. I have made the choice to return, to give them the opportunity to do the right thing. But instead of repairing the harm, they have doubled down. I have gone in and simply requested water — a request at the very center of the original ADA violation — and been told “no,” as a matter of “policy,” even after stating to them that Starbucks was now subject to a Federal Title III complaint, and that “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">water is a human right</strong>.”</p><p name="dc59" id="dc59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They know this is wrong. They know the law. And yet, even with the history, the prior harm, and the knowledge of the violation, they continue to deny the same accommodation that started this chain of events.</p><p name="32c1" id="32c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just a lingering injury. It is a living one. And Starbucks has chosen to keep it alive.</p><h3 name="ec4d" id="ec4d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When Another, Non-Corporate, Local Coffeeshop Gets It Right</h3><p name="30a0" id="30a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Yesterday, I stopped by a local coffeeshop — Gallery Roasters. It was a hot day, and I asked for a glass of water. They gave it to me without hesitation, without a purchase, and without making me feel like I was asking for something unreasonable. They’ve done this before. I thank them for being human.</p><p name="c66e" id="c66e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I told the barista there what had happened to me at Starbucks — the denials, the threats, the ADA dispute that has been dragging on since January. We agreed on something simple but important: Gallery Roasters would, of a matter of course, never refuse me, or anybody I assume, free water on a hot day, and they would never violate <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">ADA Title III</strong> by denying such a basic and reasonable accommodation.</p><p name="a7ae" id="a7ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of that, they’ve earned my repeat business for coffee purchases. Not through marketing gimmicks. Not through rewards programs. Through basic decency and legal compliance.</p><p name="b109" id="b109" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ADA does not require a business to be perfect. But it does require that public accommodations make reasonable modifications to serve customers with disabilities. In my case, that modification is not an abstract or complex request — it is a glass of water.</p><p name="b33f" id="b33f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Gallery Roasters has shown it can be done simply, respectfully, and profitably. Starbucks has shown it can be refused, escalated, and litigated. The difference is not policy. The difference is choice.</p></div></div></section>
