Crying, Neurodivergence, and the Legacy of Protest

It didn’t come with firebombs or slogans—it came with wheelchairs.</p><p name="99ea" id="99ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Activists with disabilities, many of whom had been denied basic access to schools, jobs, or even restrooms, began showing up in the corridors of federal buildings and the offices of lawmakers. In protest after protest, they lined the halls in their chairs, parked their bodies in doorways, and refused to move. Not for pity. Not for charity. For civil rights.</p><p name="af11" id="af11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They became the living architecture of resistance. Their message was clear:<br>We are not the problem. The system is.</p><p name="3e39" id="3e39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That movement helped give birth to the Americans with Disabilities Act.<br>And yet, decades later, in a so-called more inclusive world, a quieter war still rages—one with fewer wheelchairs, but just as many walls.</p><h3 name="e86f" id="e86f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Does It Mean to Be Seen?</h3><p name="d24f" id="d24f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For those of us who are neurodivergent, public space can be both a lifeline and a minefield. We exist with different emotional textures, different paces of speech, different thresholds for noise, light, pressure, stimulation. Our internal calibrations do not always match the settings of the world around us.</p><p name="7faf" id="7faf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And when our emotions overflow—when the stress becomes visible, when tears come, or we shut down, or speak too quickly, or too softly, or too much—suddenly, we become a problem. A &quot;disturbance.&quot; A reason for concern. A reason for removal.</p><p name="1e4a" id="1e4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here is the truth:</p><p name="2060" id="2060" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; Being visibly emotional in public is not a crime. It is a human right.</p><p name="e0a3" id="e0a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have the right to cry at a bench.<br>To sit quietly with panic fluttering in our chest.<br>To ask for help without being treated like a threat.<br>To breathe in a world that rushes past us.<br>To not perform neurotypicality in order to be left alone.</p><h3 name="f755" id="f755" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The New Public Access</h3><p name="d6bc" id="d6bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When those wheelchair-bound activists rolled into buildings they weren’t supposed to access, they were not simply making a point. They were making history.</p><p name="17dd" id="17dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, neurodivergent people are doing the same in subtler ways.<br>We’re asking to sit without being interrogated.<br>We’re asking for patience in checkout lines.<br>We’re asking for quiet corners, for extra seconds, for less eye contact and more grace.<br>We’re asking not to be stared at, judged, or punished for feeling deeply in public.</p><p name="54a9" id="54a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not about convenience. It’s about infrastructure—emotional infrastructure. The ramps we need aren’t just for our bodies, they’re for our hearts and minds.</p><h3 name="451d" id="451d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">You Don’t Need a Diagnosis to Deserve Kindness</h3><p name="2454" id="2454" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The next time you see someone crying in a café or frozen in a store aisle, try not to make up a story about them. Try not to assume danger, or disturbance, or deviance.</p><p name="3e7b" id="3e7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Try this instead:</p><p name="c2f3" id="c2f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; They are doing the best they can to be here with the rest of us.</p><p name="3275" id="3275" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That should be enough.</p><p name="ccee" id="ccee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because public space, at its best, is not a shopping mall. It’s a commons.<br>And if it can’t accommodate human vulnerability—if we have to hide our pain to belong—then it isn’t public at all. It’s performative.</p><h3 name="fe1b" id="fe1b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Legacy We Carry</h3><p name="b025" id="b025" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We, the neurodivergent, are the next link in a chain of civil rights that has always been about visibility.</p><p name="aa3f" id="aa3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We cry, we stim, we pause, we withdraw, we ask, we radiate—and still, we belong.</p><p name="bbf2" id="bbf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We carry the memory of those early protestors in our bodies. We line the corridors differently now, with keystrokes and blog posts and deep breaths taken under flickering fluorescent lights. But the purpose is the same:</p><p name="5081" id="5081" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To say to a watching world:</p><p name="07ab" id="07ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; We are here. We are whole. And we are not going anywhere.</p><p name="5d2b" id="5d2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">—<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p></div></div></section>
