The sun was the color of old brass and it burned just as hot. I’d been tailing trouble all week and it still stayed a step ahead, wearing heels sharp enough to cut the fabric of reality.</p><p name="8bb7" id="8bb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s when she walked in. Tall, dark hair like an event horizon. Eyes that could bend light if you stared too long. I knew her type — the kind who rearrange your particles and leave you wondering what state you were in before.</p><p name="1993" id="1993" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“My husband,” she said, her voice a low wave, “he’s… different. Like he knows things before they happen.”</p><p name="db68" id="db68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I leaned back, lit a cigarette, and let the smoke curl into a perfect spiral. “Lady, everyone’s different. Some just hide it better. But if he’s seeing around corners, that’s a problem for more than just your marriage.”</p><p name="a40b" id="a40b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She slid a photo across my desk. Him. Smiling the kind of smile you only see on gamblers who’ve read tomorrow’s paper. Next to him, a ledger full of numbers that didn’t add up — unless you accounted for spacetime distortion.</p><p name="ae02" id="ae02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d seen this before, back east, before the war: physicists who could smell the angle of a bullet before it left the chamber. I’d learned the hard way that once you start charting probabilities in this town, you stop living in it. You just <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">observe</em>.</p><p name="45bf" id="45bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That night, I followed the husband to a warehouse in San Pedro. Inside, men were playing cards. Not poker — something stranger. The chips were equations. Every hand they played collapsed another possibility. Losers walked away older, or younger, or not at all.</p><p name="205c" id="205c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stepped into the light.<br> “Evening, gentlemen. Mind if I cut the deck?”</p><p name="45ac" id="45ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They froze. I could see it in their eyes — the math, running fast. I was the variable they hadn’t calculated for. The husband reached for his coat. I reached for my .38. We both knew the equation ended in one solution.</p><p name="ebaf" id="ebaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it was done, the table was empty except for a single card face-down. I flipped it over. The Queen of Spades. Always her.</p><p name="8711" id="8711" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back in my office, I poured two fingers of rye and looked out at the city. Los Angeles was still there, buzzing and sweating under the sodium lights. But I knew better. The past was with me, and it wasn’t letting go.</p><p name="bd96" id="bd96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Physics says you can’t go back. But in this town? You never leave.</p><h3 name="0303" id="0303" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--h3-em">Chapter 2: The Past is Always With Us</em></strong></h3><p name="6e4b" id="6e4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The rain came down sideways that night, slicking the streets like a pool table just after the break. I sat there in my office with the blinds half-closed, watching the city bleed neon through the slats. The bottle was half-empty, the glass half-full, and the case was just getting started.</p><p name="137b" id="137b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’d walked away earlier — same woman, same gravity field. She had the kind of gait that rearranged a man’s sense of direction. And just before she disappeared into the wet black night, she’d thrown it over her shoulder:</p><p name="0e84" id="0e84" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“The past is always with us, Jake.”</em></p><p name="046a" id="046a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like she knew I wasn’t the kind of guy to take a sentiment like that at face value.</p><p name="15e2" id="15e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I lit another cigarette and pulled the ledger closer. Those numbers weren’t just accounts — they were coordinates. A map of where and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">when</em> things had gone wrong. San Pedro wasn’t just a port. It was a point of origin.</p><p name="dea9" id="dea9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The thing about being a physicist in a city like this — you learn fast that time isn’t linear. It’s a back alley with too many doors. Open the wrong one, and you don’t just get a bullet in the gut. You get erased.</p><p name="9820" id="9820" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started cross-referencing the entries. They matched patterns from a case I’d worked in ’35, one that had ended with a man found floating face-up in the L.A. River, his eyes wide open like he’d just seen the final theorem of the universe.</p><p name="c952" id="c952" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s when the phone rang.<br> A voice like sandpaper said:<br> “Jake, you’re looking where you shouldn’t. You’ll find yourself yesterday before you find the bottom of this.”</p><p name="9ffb" id="9ffb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The line went dead.</p><p name="349b" id="349b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I grabbed my hat and coat. If they were watching me, they already knew where I’d go next — the warehouse. The rain was letting up, the air thick with the smell of hot asphalt and bad intentions.</p><p name="e12c" id="e12c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I got there, the place was dark except for a single hanging bulb. Under it, a man I didn’t know sat at the card table, shuffling the same deck from before. But this time the chips were gone, replaced by pocket watches. Dozens of them. All ticking at different speeds.</p><p name="3f8c" id="3f8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He looked up at me, smiled the way a cat does at a crippled mouse, and said:<br> “Mr. Gittes, shall we play for time?”</p><h3 name="4a52" id="4a52" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Chapter 3: Playing for Time</strong></h3><p name="7285" id="7285" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The guy across from me had eyes like fractured mirrors — every angle showed something I didn’t want to see. He kept shuffling those watches, smooth as a con man with a brand-new deck.</p><p name="f01b" id="f01b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You understand the stakes,” he said.<br> I didn’t answer. The tick of fifty mismatched seconds was answer enough.</p><p name="7296" id="7296" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He dealt two cards face-down, one to me, one to him. The bulb above us swayed a little, throwing the shadows around like they owed rent. I flipped my first card. Queen of spades. The Black Widow. Fitting.</p><p name="b0ae" id="b0ae" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Your bet,” he said, sliding a pocket watch toward me. The thing was warm, pulsing like a trapped animal. Its hands spun slow, then faster, then slow again — mocking the rhythm of my own heartbeat.</p><p name="9d85" id="9d85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I pushed it back. “I don’t gamble with currency I can’t measure.”</p><p name="61c9" id="61c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He grinned. “That’s your problem, Mr. Gittes. You think time can be measured. In here, time is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dealt</em>.”</p><p name="1ae9" id="1ae9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We played. First hand, I lost two hours. Felt it slip — a hollow in my head, like someone had scooped out a conversation I’d had earlier that night. Second hand, I won a day. It came flooding back — an old case, a woman’s perfume, a knock on the door that had come just before dawn.</p><p name="1928" id="1928" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It wasn’t just a game. It was a physics experiment — a bad one.<br> Every card turned, every chip pushed, was shifting my own timeline. Loops opened and closed. Faces I knew rearranged themselves like I’d never met them, or had met them twice.</p><p name="e7d7" id="e7d7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’re quick,” the man said, “but you’re not quicker than <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">her</em>.”</p><p name="5393" id="5393" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I froze. “Her who?”</p><p name="06f3" id="06f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He tapped the deck. “The dealer before me. The one who set this table in motion.”</p><p name="b151" id="b151" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The watches ticked louder, each out of sync, like a jazz band with a grudge. The light swung wider, shadows stretching across the warehouse until they touched every corner.</p><p name="fe8d" id="fe8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I leaned in. “If she’s the one dealing time, then where the hell is she now?”</p><p name="2f14" id="2f14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He smiled that cat smile again. “She walked away, Mr. Gittes. Just like they all do. But the past is always with us, isn’t it?”</p><p name="6acb" id="6acb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bulb flickered.<br> The table was empty.<br> The watches were gone.</p><p name="9f23" id="9f23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I was standing in an alley in Chinatown, holding a queen of spades that was bleeding ink into my palm.</p><h3 name="676c" id="676c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Chapter 4: The Dealer Before Me</strong></h3><p name="0e65" id="0e65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Los Angeles, 1939 — a city that doesn’t know it’s already living in the future. The streetcars groan like old men, the air smells of gasoline and cheap cigars, and the night presses down like a bad decision.</p><p name="2d65" id="2d65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had a name now. Not a real one — just a whisper that the man in the warehouse had let slip: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the dealer before me.</em> No address. No photograph. Just the certainty that she’d been shuffling time long before I knew the game existed.</p><p name="7194" id="7194" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My first lead was a dive off Alameda — a jazz joint called The Spiral, where the trumpet player bent notes until they curled back on themselves. A guy at the bar told me she used to come in late, dressed in black silk and silver heels, carrying a deck in a velvet pouch. She’d deal three cards to anyone who asked, but the price wasn’t cash.</p><p name="61c7" id="61c7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“She take money?” I asked.</p><p name="4197" id="4197" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He shook his head. “She takes <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">days</em>. Good ones. Bad ones. Doesn’t matter. She shuffles ’em into her deck and you don’t see ’em again.”</p><p name="9bf9" id="9bf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside, rain slicked the street into a sheet of black glass. The neon sign of The Spiral flickered in the puddles — S-P-I-R-blank-L. Missing letters, missing days.</p><p name="587b" id="587b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second lead came from a clockmaker in Little Tokyo, a guy named Haruto. His shop was a forest of ticking.</p><p name="73a6" id="73a6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’re looking for her,” he said, not asking. “She brought me a watch once. Wouldn’t run forward. Wouldn’t run back. Just… stayed.”</p><p name="b884" id="b884" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What’d she want with it?”</p><p name="05ed" id="05ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Haruto smiled thin. “To remember something without reliving it.”</p><p name="5fd9" id="5fd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By the time I left, I had the feeling she’d been watching me since before I even sat down at that warehouse table. Like I was just another card in her deck, waiting to be played.</p><p name="9b8a" id="9b8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That night, I dreamt in split frames — my own shadow walking a different street than I was. In one, I turned left. In the other, I never left the warehouse. And somewhere in the distance, a woman’s laughter wove through the ticking, soft as silk but sharp enough to cut.</p><p name="4cdf" id="4cdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I woke, the queen of spades was still in my pocket.<br> Only now, she was holding <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">two</em> watches.</p><h3 name="b5b8" id="b5b8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Chapter 5: Three Deals in the Dark</strong></h3><p name="fca9" id="fca9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The alley was the same in every version — wet brick walls, the stink of rain-soaked garbage, and the hum of a dying streetlamp. But the woman… she wasn’t the same twice.</p><p name="ae09" id="ae09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Timeline One — The Straight Deal</strong><br> She stood at the far end of the alley, black silk catching the light like spilled ink, silver heels silent on the wet pavement. The queen of spades wasn’t in her hand — it was her hand.</p><p name="7ab7" id="7ab7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’ve been looking for me,” she said. Voice like a sax solo at 3 AM, sweet and low but hiding the knife.</p><p name="89aa" id="89aa" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I have questions,” I told her.</p><p name="9cd3" id="9cd3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’ll get answers,” she said, “but not the ones you want.” She pulled a deck from her purse, shuffled once, and dealt me three cards face down. I flipped the first — the clockmaker’s watch, frozen at midnight. The second — a photo of me I’d never posed for. The third — blank.</p><p name="a368" id="a368" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That one,” she said, pointing at the blank, “is tomorrow. You can keep it. For now.”</p><p name="9eb1" id="9eb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Timeline Two — The Crooked Hand</strong><br> Same alley, same rain, but she was smoking this time — long cigarette, longer shadow. Her smile was a trap door.</p><p name="26d5" id="26d5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’re late,” she said.</p><p name="8f7d" id="8f7d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Didn’t know I had an appointment.”</p><p name="9473" id="9473" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She laughed without humor. “You had it the day you walked into that warehouse. The moment you touched the deck, you belonged to it.”</p><p name="3f15" id="3f15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She offered me a card — queen of spades again, but this time her eyes were closed in the picture. “Every choice you make buys you a different version of me,” she said. “Some cost more than others.”</p><p name="244f" id="244f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I looked down, the card had turned into a mirror, and in it I saw myself holding the deck. Only my hands were older. Much older.</p><p name="2c56" id="2c56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Timeline Three — The Double Cross</strong><br> The alley was empty until it wasn’t. She was right behind me, whispering in my ear before I even heard her footsteps.</p><p name="a563" id="a563" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You think you’ve been chasing me,” she said. “But I’ve been walking you to this moment since before you were born.”</p><p name="ea25" id="ea25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I turned — she had the queen of spades pinned to my chest like a badge. I hadn’t felt it slip under my coat.</p><p name="d882" id="d882" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Play it,” she said.</p><p name="eeb3" id="eeb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I pulled it free, and the whole alley folded in on itself, bricks collapsing into cards, rain turning into a shower of clocks, all ticking down to the same second.</p><p name="c5cb" id="c5cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I came to, I was back in my office — but three decks sat on my desk, each missing the queen of spades.</p><p name="16d8" id="16d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhere between the timelines, I realized the truth:<br> She didn’t just deal cards. She dealt <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">realities.</em></p><h3 name="f6c5" id="f6c5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Chapter 6: Meg Tilly Walks Through the Frame</strong></h3><p name="33b0" id="33b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was shuffling the three decks, trying to line up the queens in some kind of sequence that made sense, when the office door creaked open.<br> No knock. No shadow. Just her.</p><p name="55cf" id="55cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Meg Tilly.<br> Not a character. Not a role. The actress. In my office like she’d walked off a movie set in 1985 and never bothered to change her shoes.</p><p name="f1bf" id="f1bf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’re wondering why I’m here,” she said, easing into the chair opposite me.<br> Her voice was exactly the same as in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Agnes of God</em> — soft, clear, but with a weight that could break glass.</p><p name="6d43" id="6d43" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Lady,” I said, “I’m wondering how you got here. This isn’t even your picture.”</p><p name="8b56" id="8b56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She smiled like she knew the answer but didn’t want to give it up yet. “Some doors in Hollywood aren’t sets. Some of them are exits.” She looked at the cards on my desk and touched one. The ink bled under her fingers, rearranging itself into a frame of celluloid.</p><p name="ba94" id="ba94" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You think you’re playing with cards,” she said. “But these are edits. Cuts. You can splice your way into someone else’s story if you know the sequence.”</p><p name="cb2d" id="cb2d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why tell me?” I asked.</p><p name="67a4" id="67a4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Because,” she said, leaning forward so close I could see the reflection of the rain outside in her eyes, “your woman with the queen of spades? She’s been cutting the same scene into every timeline for decades. I think she’s trying to get final cut on reality.”</p><p name="eb84" id="eb84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The light flickered, just once, and for a second I swore I heard a director yell, “Reset!”</p><h3 name="f635" id="f635" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Chapter 7: The Splice</strong></h3><p name="2592" id="2592" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Meg didn’t stand — she pivoted.<br> One second, she was in my office chair; the next, she was leaning on the edge of my desk, pulling a length of film stock from her coat pocket like it was a string of pearls.<br> Black-and-white frames. A man, a woman, a desert road. The kind of scene you only see if you’ve got clearance to watch the rushes.</p><p name="ab03" id="ab03" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Watch this,” she said, holding the strip to the desk lamp.</p><p name="64f9" id="64f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The light punched through the sprocket holes, throwing moving shadows across my wall. The figures in the frames twitched. Then one of them — the woman — turned her head and looked right at me.</p><p name="7d71" id="7d71" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Cute trick,” I said.</p><p name="61cc" id="61cc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Not a trick,” she replied. “An edit.”<br> She snapped her fingers and the sound hit me like a reel change — a sharp metallic punch that made the air taste like copper.</p><p name="0829" id="0829" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suddenly, my office walls peeled back like matte paintings. The rain stopped. The fan’s hum dissolved into the low rumble of a projector. I was standing on a catwalk above a soundstage, looking down at my own desk.</p><p name="e6ce" id="e6ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Meg was still there, but now she was wearing a headset mic and a laminated pass. Her name tag didn’t say <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Meg Tilly</em>. It said <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Script Supervisor</em>.</p><p name="3eda" id="3eda" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’re not real,” she said. “Not unless you keep talking.”</p><p name="16e6" id="16e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the far end of the stage, a booming voice yelled, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Jake!
