I wish to express my appreciation for your intervention and your enforcement of my legal rights in that moment. However, I believe it is important to draw your attention to the highly inappropriate — and potentially coercive — behavior of the two locksmiths involved.</p><h3 name="6824" id="6824" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Summary of Concerning Behavior:</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="c864" id="c864" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Interference with Police Communication:</strong><br> While I was attempting to speak with Barbara via speakerphone in the presence of law enforcement, one of the locksmiths physically led Barbara away from the phone call and into another room — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">while I was actively relaying questions from the officer to her.</strong> This action directly interfered with a police-mediated negotiation and may have prevented her from hearing or responding to law enforcement instructions.</li><li name="c256" id="c256" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Non-verbal Intimidation and Presence Control:</strong><br> The lead locksmith entered my physical space in a silent, confrontational posture. Although I remained calm and did not retaliate, he <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">invaded my personal space</strong> and positioned himself between myself and Barbara — and then guided her away during the conversation, without legal justification or communication. This was an escalation beyond the duties of a contracted locksmith and appeared to serve an intimidatory purpose.</li><li name="16fc" id="16fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Complete Lack of Professional Engagement:</strong><br> Neither locksmith acknowledged me, greeted me, nor explained their role — even though I was clearly a resident being affected by their actions. Their behavior was silent, coordinated, and abnormal for standard locksmithing conduct.</li><li name="3b51" id="3b51" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Attempted Influence Over the Resident:</strong><br> By physically removing Barbara from a call with the police, the locksmith appeared to be guiding or influencing her decision-making during an active legal dispute. This behavior exceeds the role of a technician and enters the realm of potential coercion or undue influence.</li><li name="edd5" id="edd5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Additionally, at the time of the incident, signs and other memorabilia were ripped and removed from their display under my control. Some of these elements were stolen completely by these parties — a search revealed no trace of them, a detail relayed to the police in my report; the fact that the signs were asking for public assistance is ironic in that I am being evicted and need public assistance yet they would remove the signs asking for such assistance, evidence of a deeper motive — to disrupt.</li></ul><h3 name="75e1" id="75e1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Why This Matters:</h3><p name="5a8c" id="5a8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">At a time when the dispute was being de-escalated and handled lawfully by your department, these third-party individuals acted in a way that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">escalated tension, blocked communication, and potentially obstructed a lawful inquiry.</strong> I do not know whether they were acting under specific instructions or acting independently, but their conduct warrants concern.</p></div></div></section><section name="0d48" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="94fe" id="94fe" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Request for Review:</h3><p name="46cb" id="46cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I respectfully request that your department:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="f316" id="f316" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Review the bodycam footage or officer report of the incident (if available)</li><li name="d3d4" id="d3d4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Log this letter as part of the Incident Report</li><li name="095d" id="095d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Contact me if you require any further details or documentation (photos, timeline, etc.)</li><li name="d614" id="d614" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Consider communicating with the locksmith company involved to clarify professional boundaries during law enforcement interactions</li></ol></div></div></section><section name="c6d3" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="8a75" id="8a75" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Again, I want to thank the responding officer for protecting my rights and ensuring lawful process during a very difficult situation.
