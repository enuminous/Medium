Not a small one, not a “shake it off and move on” one — a full-body, heart-racing, breathless, reality-narrowing panic attack. And when I left where I was, I made a conscious choice: I was going to go to that same Starbucks I’ve been a customer at for years, sit outside in the open air, and let my body and mind come down.</p><p name="9d3c" id="9d3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That was the plan.</p><p name="ffbc" id="ffbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What happened instead was something I’ve been living for years now — the ongoing, deliberate harassment and retaliation from a corporation that refuses to acknowledge the reality of my disabilities.</p><p name="adb0" id="adb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Setup</p><p name="8194" id="8194" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No other customers outside.<br>I wasn’t inside their store.<br>I wasn’t bothering anyone.</p><p name="f94f" id="f94f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just me, my phone, and my work.</p><p name="6b9a" id="6b9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then a Starbucks employee walked outside directly to where I was sitting. Not to greet me. Not to offer me service. But to enforce “policy” — the same line they’ve been leaning on in this dispute for months — and make sure I knew that I was sitting in a “customers only” area.</p><p name="40db" id="40db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A decade of buying their coffee and food apparently doesn’t count for anything.</p><p name="39de" id="39de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Notice Ignored</p><p name="f0fd" id="f0fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I told him immediately: I have a Title III ADA complaint pending with the Department of Justice.<br>I’d told Starbucks I have panic attacks, anxiety disorder, OCD, and autism spectrum disorder — all conditions I have disclosed publicly, over and over.<br>I told him I was here because I needed a quiet place to recover.</p><p name="3c45" id="3c45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That should have been the end of it.<br>A decent human being — and certainly a company trained in disability rights compliance — would have walked away.</p><p name="36c0" id="36c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He didn’t.</p><p name="dcc4" id="dcc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Performative Harassment</p><p name="19fb" id="19fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, he continued.<br>Performative, condescending, like my rights were an inconvenience to his script.</p><p name="5f3e" id="5f3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I lost my composure — because being targeted when you are already in the middle of emotional recovery is not something anyone should have to endure. I told him: You triggered this.</p><p name="3983" id="3983" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His body language became defensive, antagonistic, he huffed like my protests were interfering with his ability to do his job. I could even see the fear in his eyes if he didn’t harass me, because possibly his manager had made sure that I was to be addressed by name and then excluded. Yes, this man asked me if I was Matthew before saying anything else. They knew who I was.</p><p name="c309" id="c309" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then, through tears, I asked him for a cup of water. Something small. Something that would at least acknowledge I’m human.</p><p name="e39e" id="e39e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He smirked and asked, “Do you want ice with that?”<br>And then… nothing. Two minutes. Three minutes. Still no water.</p><p name="6831" id="6831" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why This Matters</p><p name="af30" id="af30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks knows my disabilities. They know I have a DOJ complaint. They know the law requires them to accommodate and avoid triggering situations that worsen my conditions.</p><p name="743d" id="743d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, they sent someone to approach me, to press a point they’ve pressed before, to drive me into yet another panic spiral, and then to fail to deliver even the smallest gesture of decency.</p><p name="f30f" id="f30f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just bad customer service.<br>This is not just rudeness.<br>This is retaliation.</p><p name="7751" id="7751" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the Record</p><p name="e4cb" id="e4cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve said it before: the ADA isn’t a suggestion.<br>You don’t get to decide my disability “doesn’t count today.”<br>And you don’t get to march me to your corporate drum when my rights say otherwise.</p><p name="c758" id="c758" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was sitting there, minding my own business, doing my work, in a place I’ve given my money for a decade. And they decided that even that was too much to allow.</p><p name="e55b" id="e55b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is my reality. And until it changes, I’m going to keep writing it down — because that’s how we do.</p><h3 name="0799" id="0799" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Starbucks Just Called Me Out By Name — And Made It Clear This Was No Accident</h3><p name="ff15" id="ff15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Today, Starbucks officially crossed the line from corporate indifference into targeted retaliation.</p><p name="c890" id="c890" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was sitting outside one of their stores, minding my own business, doing nothing more than trying to breathe after a panic attack. Out of nowhere, a man stepped outside, looked straight at me, and said:</p><p name="3027" id="3027" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “Are you Matthew?”</p><p name="cd91" id="cd91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not “sir.” Not “excuse me.” Not “hello.”</p><p name="5ee1" id="5ee1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By name.</p><p name="8368" id="8368" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This Was Not Random</p><p name="161d" id="161d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This wasn’t some random enforcement of a “customers only” seating policy. This was direct. Personal. And deliberate.</p><p name="4133" id="4133" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it wasn’t just the tone — it was the fact that I’ve been a paying customer for over a decade, that I was sitting quietly outside, and that there was no legitimate reason to single me out except one: to make sure I “obey” Starbucks’ policy at all times.</p><p name="c360" id="c360" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Except here’s the problem: their policy, as they’ve applied it to me, violates the law.</p><p name="e0e2" id="e0e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I Told Him — And He Kept Going</p><p name="566e" id="566e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t hide anything.<br>I told him right there that what he was doing was retaliation against a federally protected whistleblower with an active Title III ADA case against Starbucks.</p><p name="e72c" id="e72c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then I told him to leave me alone.</p><p name="493b" id="493b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But he didn’t stop.<br>He kept going. Performatively.<br>Like he was acting out some script he’d been handed from above.</p><p name="4d22" id="4d22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Water That Never Came</p><p name="39cf" id="39cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At one point, through tears, I asked him for a cup of water. He even asked me if I wanted ice in it. And then… nothing.</p><p name="c2ae" id="c2ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I was talking with the security guard he had apparently called, the water never arrived. When I finally went back into the Starbucks, the guard tried to stall me from entering and then followed me inside.</p><p name="f983" id="f983" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked right up to the man and said, flatly:</p><p name="db09" id="db09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “You promised me water. You even asked if I wanted ice in it. And then you failed to bring it out to me while I was having a panic attack and in distress — because of you.”</p><p name="468e" id="468e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Putting It On the Record</p><p name="f904" id="f904" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t stop there. I raised my voice so the one other person in the store could hear me:</p><p name="4628" id="4628" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I have filed a Title III action against Starbucks for calling the police on me on April 18th.”</p><p name="d008" id="d008" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the other employees — someone who knew me — looked genuinely shocked and panicked. I looked straight at her and said:</p><p name="f9d5" id="f9d5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes. This is why I have filed a discrimination suit. And water is a civil right. It is a human right.”</p><p name="c111" id="c111" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Pressure From Above</p><p name="e861" id="e861" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s be real — no frontline employee decides to confront a known whistleblower, by name, in the middle of an ADA case, without pressure from somewhere up the chain.</p><p name="6e55" id="6e55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The look on his face wasn’t casual. It was tight. Forced. Like someone had told him, “Go out there and make sure he knows the rules. We don’t care if he’s in the middle of a panic attack.”</p><p name="e825" id="e825" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If that’s true, that’s a culture problem — a top-down rot — and it’s happening inside one of the most visible brands in America.</p><p name="511a" id="511a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s Going Wrong With Starbucks?</p><p name="6706" id="6706" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks has positioned itself publicly as progressive, community-focused, and inclusive. But when you strip away the PR, here’s what I’ve seen:</p><p name="6bb0" id="6bb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A willingness to target a customer by name in public.</p><p name="9bf4" id="9bf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A readiness to ignore a federal ADA complaint and keep pressing.</p><p name="4074" id="4074" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An apparent comfort with turning policy enforcement into public humiliation.</p><p name="8df0" id="8df0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A failure to provide even the smallest human kindness — like a promised glass of water — when a customer is in visible distress.</p><p name="356d" id="356d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just bad optics — it’s illegal. It’s retaliation. And it’s the opposite of what they claim to stand for.</p><p name="bdb2" id="bdb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Starbucks, I have one question for you:<br>What the f* is going wrong in your company that you think this is acceptable?**</p></div></div></section>
