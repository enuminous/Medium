Upon doing so, I was connected with a staff member who contradicted this message and denied that any such person was available. When I pointed out the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">logical inconsistency and procedural error</strong>, I was told no one could help me.</p><p name="cef5" id="cef5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I then disclosed my status as a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">federal whistleblower</strong>, attempting to report a matter of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">national security and public safety</strong>, the staff member <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">immediately terminated the call.</strong></p><p name="ccb2" id="ccb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Upon calling back, I was met with a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">deliberate refusal to answer</strong>, followed by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">another immediate disconnection</strong>.

I will not be contacting my friend directly, of course, but I hope she knows that I am fighting for her right to think freely. She had a psychiatric event, and was hospitalized, and her brother in law assaulted me. All indications are that her communications with me are being monitored and interfered with; I have yet to be allowed to communicate with her directly, and I have no proof that she is actually okay — even our mutual friend who has contacted her is aware that she has been destabilized in an effort to derail me. I am not an abuser — why would anyone think that the person who is trying to give this knowledge to the world would also be such a villian?</em></strong></p><p name="f876" id="f876" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Respectfully,<br> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Matthew Chenoweth Wright</strong><br> Federal whistleblower<br> April 10, 2025</p></div></div></section>
