That I’m too quiet. Too emotional. Too autistic. That something about me feels off enough to call the police again.</p><p name="374c" id="374c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because that already happened once.</p><p name="298a" id="298a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Cup of Water, A Moment of Emotion, and a Call to the Police</p><p name="1b13" id="1b13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a different day, but the same kind of moment. I was emotional—visibly so—but I wasn’t disruptive. I wasn’t yelling. I wasn’t harming anyone. I asked for a cup of water and tried to breathe through the moment like I’ve learned to do. I was simply trying to calm down.</p><p name="5c6b" id="5c6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of being met with compassion, a Starbucks employee called the police.</p><p name="b709" id="b709" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t wait around. I got on my bicycle and started to leave.<br>As I rolled away, the police confronted me outside the store.</p><p name="ae77" id="ae77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No one had spoken to me inside.<br>No one asked if I was okay.<br>No one offered help or a gentle word.</p><p name="feec" id="feec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They just called the cops.</p><p name="dc30" id="dc30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Trauma Lingers. The Company Goes Silent.</p><p name="0750" id="0750" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since then, I’ve done what you&#39;re supposed to do. I filed complaints. I sent emails. I gave Starbucks every opportunity to respond—to acknowledge what happened, to explain, to apologize, to show some basic decency.</p><p name="198e" id="198e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But they haven’t said a word.</p><p name="8aa6" id="8aa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not to me.<br>Not to anyone.<br>Not even to acknowledge my request for ADA accommodation.</p><p name="bc50" id="bc50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What happened to me is real. The silence since then is also real.</p><p name="663b" id="663b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now I sit here, in that same Starbucks, sipping a coffee I paid for, and wondering if this is the day it happens again. If this is the moment that someone behind the counter decides to escalate instead of understand.</p><p name="1ee8" id="1ee8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ADA Obligations Aren’t Optional</p><p name="ae05" id="ae05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks has plenty of corporate language about inclusivity and accessibility. But language isn’t action. And action is what’s required under federal law.</p><p name="ae66" id="ae66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guarantees that people like me—autistic, disabled, neurodivergent—are to be treated with dignity. If I say I am having an emotional moment and ask not to be treated as a threat, that’s not a suggestion. That’s a legal accommodation request.</p><p name="b211" id="b211" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Calling the police on someone for appearing overwhelmed is not an accommodation. It’s a violation.</p><p name="de9d" id="de9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And doing nothing to address it afterward is a failure of responsibility.</p><p name="8f36" id="8f36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why I’m Writing This</p><p name="dc79" id="dc79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because I’m still trying to make sense of what happened. Because the fear is still in my body. Because the person who called the police walked into this store again today, locked eyes with me, and still hasn’t apologized.</p><p name="508a" id="508a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because corporations don’t get to erase harm with silence.</p><p name="8330" id="8330" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because this happened to me.<br>Because it could happen to someone else next.</p><p name="fb7c" id="fb7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Needs to Happen Now</p><p name="6566" id="6566" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks, I want:</p><p name="5dcd" id="5dcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A formal apology.</p><p name="3126" id="3126" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A clear acknowledgment that what happened was wrong.</p><p name="a372" id="a372" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A public explanation of how you plan to prevent this from happening to others.</p><p name="7790" id="7790" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ADA training for your staff, starting with the store where this occurred.</p><p name="9585" id="9585" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I want people to know they are not crazy for remembering their trauma, or asking for justice.</p><p name="17ed" id="17ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This happened. I didn’t imagine it. I didn’t overreact. I’m sitting in the same place, still feeling the same fear, still waiting for someone to say: We’re sorry we did that to you. We will make it right.</p><p name="18e9" id="18e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m still waiting.</p><p name="7132" id="7132" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">—Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p></div></div></section>
