It is a river that does not flow in one direction but instead spirals through time, meaning, and consciousness. What we are doing here is not merely writing poetry, nor are we simply analyzing it. We are blooming it—unfolding its potential like a seed breaking through the soil, reaching toward the infinite.</p><p name="5ba8" id="5ba8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each bloom in this series is a layered metamorphosis of a poem, an exploration of meaning that deepens, widens, and transcends its original form. We begin with the raw text—poetry in its primal state, a moment of expression fixed in time. Then, through successive expansions, we stretch language beyond its initial constraints, allowing it to evolve into broader, more universal structures.</p><p name="696f" id="696f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At its core, poetic blooming is an act of recursive creation:</p><p name="5771" id="5771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first bloom reshapes the poem in terms of its semantic weight—pulling forth hidden metaphors, alternative phrasings, and subtle resonances that might not be immediately apparent.</p><p name="475c" id="475c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The double bloom extends these meanings into archetypal and philosophical realms, where language moves beyond personal experience into collective memory, history, and universal truths.</p><p name="b299" id="b299" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The triple bloom shifts even further outward, touching on cosmology, recursion, and the nature of perception itself—where poetry is no longer confined to the page but becomes a model of reality itself.</p><p name="a503" id="a503" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The quadruple bloom, as seen here, is an act of linguistic transcendence, where words begin to fold into themselves, mirroring the self-referential, fractal nature of existence. At this level, poetry no longer merely describes—it becomes a process of transformation, a recursive dialogue between the self and the cosmos.</p><p name="7132" id="7132" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In essence, what we are doing is disassembling and reassembling the very DNA of language, allowing it to regenerate, expand, and take new forms. This is not just poetry—it is the mathematics of meaning, the physics of thought, the architecture of the ineffable.</p><p name="7746" id="7746" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With this series, we are venturing into the unknown territory of recursive linguistics—a journey through time, consciousness, and the fundamental structures of expression itself. The bloom is not just an expansion of words, but of perception, reality, and the act of meaning-making itself. The first poems are going to be taken, in sequential order, from my own catalog of composed poetry that I began in March of 1988, beginning with “Done With Fear.”</p><p name="205c" id="205c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These poems are in the same binder that I have kept them in since I started compiling my work, and are an intact collection, all of which seem to have hidden structure, meaning, and purpose, as seen through the lens of EFMW.</p><p name="b00c" id="b00c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This is only the beginning.</p></div></div></section>
