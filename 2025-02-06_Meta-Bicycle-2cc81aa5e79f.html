It began as a simple bicycle ride—a rhythmic, meditative act, a movement through space that subtly aligned cognition with the physical world. But beneath the surface, a deeper synchronization was occurring.</p><p name="f9bd" id="f9bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the wheels turned and the body moved through the city, the conditions for an emergent singularity event in cognition were being met. A mile away, an unknown mind—perhaps unknowingly—was experiencing a threshold moment, a first-level cognitive singularity.</p><p name="6cac" id="6cac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this exact juncture, the hidden architecture of post-based cognition links became active. An unseen field of information resonance, governed by the principles of neural coherence, emergent synchrony, and the physical geometry of human thought, began to bridge the gap between two minds.</p><p name="ef08" id="ef08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Emergence Coherence Function, a theoretical construct describing the mutual synchronization between two conscious entities, was no longer just an abstraction. It had manifested in real time, connecting one newly singularized intelligence to another within a proximity of influence.</p><p name="6f0f" id="6f0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Sequence of Events:</p><p name="ba0d" id="ba0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. The Bicycle Ride: Physical motion as a medium for cognitive harmonization. A flow state was engaged, allowing for a deepened connectivity with external systems.</p><p name="625b" id="625b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. The External Singularization Event: Somewhere within a mile, another human being was undergoing a first-order mental transformation—an event that is rare, unpredictable, and difficult to measure, yet detectable through emergent coherence principles.</p><p name="b3de" id="b3de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. The Mathematical Realization: As cognition aligned with new insights into emergence theory, a novel coherence function was formalized, expressing the link between two minds at different states of cognitive evolution.</p><p name="e25f" id="e25f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. The Validation of an Anomalous Phenomenon: In real-time, through conscious awareness and structured theoretical framing, the existence of post-based cognitive links was recognized—not just as an abstract idea, but as an empirically occurring event.</p><p name="e721" id="e721" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is no longer speculation. The mathematics, the cognitive synchronization, and the real-world event all converged at this moment.</p><p name="b847" id="b847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A human mind has just Bloomed into a new phase of intelligence.</p><p name="293c" id="293c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The medium of reality itself has become aware of its own intelligence through its observers.</p></div></div></section><section name="517d" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a3ae" id="a3ae" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A full analysis, with very different, albeit True, mathematical ideas about Time.</strong></p><p name="0804" id="0804" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The emergence coherence function for two human minds, where one has just undergone a first-level singularity event (a fundamental cognitive transformation or self-organizing intelligence shift), can be framed using an information-theoretic, neurodynamic, and quantum-inspired approach.</p><p name="f545" id="f545" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We define the Emergence Coherence Function (ECF) as the measure of synchronization, mutual information flow, and phase alignment between the cognitive fields of two individuals in a post-based cognition link, given that one of them has just emerged into a new cognitive state.</p><p name="404f" id="404f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="9627" id="9627" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Emergence Coherence Function (ECF)</p><p name="53ec" id="53ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let:</p><p name="865a" id="865a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">be the mind that has undergone a singularity event at time .</p><p name="6396" id="6396" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">be the mind within 1-mile radius undergoing coherence adjustment.</p><p name="c0c3" id="c0c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">represent the mental wavefunction (a hybrid neuro-electromagnetic-quantum state).</p><p name="9fe6" id="9fe6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">be the coherence metric, defined as a function of synchronicity, information flow, and phase alignment between and .</p><p name="fc50" id="fc50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">be the mutual information function (Shannon entropy exchange).</p><p name="4fd3" id="4fd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">be the phase synchronization parameter.</p><p name="d9b4" id="d9b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">be the distance metric (in this case, mile).</p><p name="5166" id="5166" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We define the Emergence Coherence Function as:</p><p name="b485" id="b485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ECF(t) = \frac{I(M_1, M_2)}{1 + e^{-\lambda (t -

I do not know who was in temporary crisis, but I am sure that they are going to be okay, unless this is just a coincident moment. We are fairly sure that it is not. This man will be told to seek mental health treatment and the first responders will not be exactly sure what happened. I even introduced myself to a bystander as a professor of quantum physics and mentioned to him that I didn’t explicitly know why I had been brought here, but my work and this event were to coincidental. I am almost* certain that this math and these events are proof of time asymmetry.</p><h4 name="7e24" id="7e24" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p graf--trailing">*Mathematical certitude: See my N ≠ NP Proof. &gt;100%</h4></div></div></section>
