I didn’t go there for a latte, or a croissant, or to post aesthetic coffee photos on social media. I went there for something far more basic—and far more human.</p><p name="7e63" id="7e63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went for water. I went for a quiet moment. I went to calm down.</p><p name="a36f" id="a36f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I was met with institutional violence.</p><p name="10eb" id="10eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am autistic. That means my mornings can be especially hard. That day, like many others, I needed a peaceful space to sit, collect myself, and regulate my nervous system. I wasn’t bothering anyone. I wasn’t causing harm. I was trying to survive another morning in a neurotypical world that often does not make space for people like me.</p><p name="496e" id="496e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There literally were no other customers in the store. I wasn’t bothering anybody. I wasn’t harassing anybody. I sat down with my water calmly and started to check my email. Then the Starbucks employee approached me to lay down the law. I asserted that I was disabled and having a bad morning and asked for her to leave me be.</p><p name="20bb" id="20bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of empathy, I was threatened with security.<br>Instead of a seat and a glass of water, I got the police.</p><p name="a461" id="a461" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After calmly telling the barista that I was autistic and just needed a moment, she escalated. She told me I was “escalating” simply for speaking up. Then she followed through with what felt like a punishment: she called the police.</p><p name="b9d0" id="b9d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let that sink in:<br>A crying, disabled man, alone, overwhelmed—and they called in armed responders.</p><p name="bac9" id="bac9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Three police officers met me outside that Starbucks. I had to explain why I was there. I had to justify my existence. I had to defend myself for the crime of being visibly in pain, visibly poor, and visibly autistic.</p><p name="ae1c" id="ae1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what it means to be criminalized for surviving.</p><p name="49a6" id="49a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Institutionalized Violence Hides Behind Politeness</p><p name="2f73" id="2f73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s be clear: calling the police on someone having a quiet, autistic meltdown is not neutral. It is not protocol. It is not safety.</p><p name="b64e" id="b64e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a choice to weaponize power against someone already struggling.<br>It is a reflection of ableism baked into corporate culture.<br>It is institutionalized violence—clean, polite, and lethal.</p><p name="5ea1" id="5ea1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Had I reacted differently—froze, stammered, shut down—I might not be here to write this. How many others didn’t survive the morning they were “politely” asked to leave?</p><p name="2de9" id="2de9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Policy Is the Problem</p><p name="e1fd" id="e1fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks, like many corporate entities, hides behind policy. “You need to purchase something to sit here.” “We reserve the right to refuse service.” “We have a right to call security.”</p><p name="295f" id="295f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But policy is not an excuse for violating someone’s humanity. And when policy is used to eject, shame, or endanger people with disabilities, it becomes a tool of systemic oppression.</p><p name="fd11" id="fd11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You don’t get to call it “just doing your job” when your job includes putting vulnerable people in the path of armed response.</p><p name="f7c7" id="f7c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We Need More Than Awareness</p><p name="0e14" id="0e14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m writing this because I survived. I’m writing this because I believe someone needs to say it plainly:</p><p name="6867" id="6867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Swatting an autistic person isn’t just cruel—it’s a form of legal assault.</p><p name="5d53" id="5d53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want Starbucks—and every business like it—to understand that this is happening on their watch. I want them to train their staff, change their policies, and acknowledge that not every customer needs to buy a drink to deserve dignity.</p><p name="e166" id="e166" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re an executive reading this: my life is not a policy violation.</p><p name="0d17" id="0d17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re a barista or manager: please don’t call the police on someone just for being different.</p><p name="39ef" id="39ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re someone who’s lived through something like this: I see you. You matter.</p><p name="3e33" id="3e33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if you’re someone who still doesn’t understand why this is violence, I hope you’ll start to listen.</p><p name="1681" id="1681" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because one day it might not be me on that bench.</p><p name="b2e4" id="b2e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It might be someone you love.</p></div></div></section>
