I followed that with: “Your employee just denied me water.” I then exited the building.</p><p name="0fb7" id="0fb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He knew exactly what that meant.</p><p name="5e9b" id="5e9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Because that wasn’t just a one-off mistake—it was the very heart of the previous ADA complaint: being refused a basic human necessity, while visibly distressed, by a corporation that calls itself a third space. Just two days prior I had told the same man that my name wasn’t Allison, but Matthew, and that corporate had f***** up by misnaming and misgendering me in an active Ada communication.</p></div></div></section><section name="efdc" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="47ec" id="47ec" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Months ago, I was crying at 5:30 in the morning after having been given water, and then threatened with police, and asked to leave.
