Kurtz (Marlon Brando’s renegade soldier/philosopher, targeted for ‘’termination with extreme predjudice’’ by Martin Sheen’s torn and disillusioned Capt. Willard in Francis Ford Copolla’s 1975 retooling of Joseph Conrad’s novel “Heart of Darkness”) recites quotes from T. S. Eliot’s poem “The Hollow Men”:</p><p name="68b6" id="68b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">We are the hollow men</strong></p><p name="f238" id="f238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">We are the stuffed men</strong></p><p name="9dbc" id="9dbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Leaning together</strong></p><p name="9418" id="9418" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!</strong></p><p name="93c2" id="93c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Our dried voices, when</strong></p><p name="2ba7" id="2ba7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">We whisper together</strong></p><p name="2a0b" id="2a0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Are quiet and meaningless</strong></p><p name="602d" id="602d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">As wind in dry grass</strong></p><p name="190f" id="190f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Or rats’ feet over broken glass</strong></p><p name="c942" id="c942" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In our dry cellar</strong></p><p name="e2ff" id="e2ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">…</strong></p><p name="bd0c" id="bd0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">…</strong></p><p name="ea6e" id="ea6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is the way the world ends</strong></p><p name="d8bd" id="d8bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Not with a bang but a whimper.</strong></p><p name="1603" id="1603" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the segment of film this poem is quoted in, there are very deep tones, shadows and humidity, and air of resigned finality, of ceasing to struggle, and an almost pungent visual atmosphere, the interior of Col. Kurtz’s house of death, a decaying playhouse the camera plays to, measuring in a poetic way the desperate interplay between Brando and Sheen, with the poem’s visual images of defeat complementing the film’s images in a way that adds an extra element to the poem’s meaning, making the words more intimate — more about Col. Kurtz’s insanity and self-aware mediocrity.</p><p name="4730" id="4730" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The poem changes, and the movie segment is made more emotionally impacting.</p><p name="c2ac" id="c2ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the film “Four Weddings &amp; a Funeral”, images of a funeral procession sadly winding it’s way to the chapel are complemented by the reading by a mourner of the poem “Funeral Blues” by W. H. Auden.</p><p name="68b8" id="68b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The combination of the stark images in this poem stand in direct sympathy with the visual identity of this scene, again creating a synergy and an addition to both the film and the poem, exceeding the bounds of both.</p><p name="e514" id="e514" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Showing a metaphorical link rather than a direct connection is a different technique, showcased in some movies by using elements such as mirrors or water to suggest sexuality and desire, or other more dreamlike images, such as in the movie “Akira Kurosawa’s Dreams”, in which very poetic images are woven between poetic and dialogue-driven segments.</p><p name="e1cb" id="e1cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Metaphorical images combine with solid, yet dream-like visual film to create a fantastic world for the audience to participate in, because poetry must have its images come directly from the listener’s own experience.</p><p name="a05d" id="a05d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lyric film is a subjective experience for that very reason; the audience carries it’s own world into the movie theater to merge with the world of a film. As Juan Egea (2007) wrote,</p><p name="2a22" id="2a22" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“To state that a film is lyrical or poetic seems to promise a cinematic experience that will somehow differ from our ordinary experience of movies as storytelling.</em></p><p name="6596" id="6596" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Such a statement also seems to assume that poetry creates a stir in the film’s flow, that it hints at the road not taken for cinema as artistic production, that — if only for a fleeting moment — the medium of the moving picture is exonerated from being simply entertainment, just plot- oriented fiction or the mere photographic projection of reality.</p><p name="e5d1" id="e5d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To state that a film is poetic ultimately suggests that we may in fact know what both the lyric and cinema really are. It is, after all, a matter of essences.”</p><p name="8146" id="8146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of the extra layer of abstraction found in image poetry, it’s art mutates when translated to screen, and the segments of film that are poetic also differ from pure film for much the same reasons; dialogue in film references the action, continuity and characters, and is also wedded to the images, but only these poetic moments in movies can create a completely direct emotional connection with the audience — the poems are usually familiar and resonant works, which is the reason they are usually included in such films, and can take the experiencer deeper into the reality of the film, seeing a sympathetic or contrasting image combined with abstract words.</p><p name="ca4a" id="ca4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bibliography</p><p name="d934" id="d934" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dillon, S.
