These establishments were widely reported to have included prostitution as part of their draw.<br>More than a century later, the United States is still looking at headlines about sex for sale — only now the brothels have URLs, private jets, and offshore accounts.</p><p name="c3ad" id="c3ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the Backpage.com takedown in 2018 to the collapse of Jeffrey Epstein’s network in 2019, the scale and sophistication have changed, but the transaction hasn’t. Women’s bodies — and in some cases, girls’ bodies — are still traded openly in systems that intersect with politics, business, and culture.</p><p name="70c4" id="70c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Backpage: The Digital Marketplace</p><p name="c49a" id="c49a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Backpage didn’t invent the online sex trade — it industrialized it.<br>By the time federal prosecutors seized its servers, the site’s “adult services” section had become a hub for both consensual sex work and trafficking victims, with ads posted in dozens of U.S. cities every day.<br>The removal of Backpage’s listings didn’t end the trade. It fractured it into encrypted apps, invite-only groups, and new marketplaces with the same buyers and sellers.</p><p name="a349" id="a349" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Epstein: The Private Network</p><p name="8f6e" id="8f6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jeffrey Epstein’s operation was not a street-level marketplace; it was a curated network for the wealthy and connected. It involved recruiters, transporters, financiers, and cover entities — from Southern Trust Co. in the U.S. Virgin Islands to private aviation firms and island compounds.<br>The collapse of his network didn’t end the demand. The infrastructure — financial, logistical, and social — is still visible in corporate registries, settlement records, and unexplained renewals of shell companies.</p><p name="9b26" id="9b26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hollywood, High Society, and the Cultural Cover</p><p name="004f" id="004f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t confined to the “underworld.”</p><p name="5d7e" id="5d7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">High-profile “Hollywood madam” cases showed how elite client lists overlap with politics, entertainment, and corporate leadership.</p><p name="c485" id="c485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The pornography industry, legal but largely unregulated, blurs the line between autonomy and exploitation, creating a cultural backdrop where the commodification of women’s bodies is normalized.</p><p name="182f" id="182f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both spheres feed the same underlying narrative: that access to women’s bodies is a resource to be purchased, whether in cash, influence, or career advancement.</p><p name="3c96" id="3c96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Intersectional Reality</p><p name="434f" id="434f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sex trade in America is not a monolith. It operates on multiple levels:</p><p name="cc50" id="cc50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Street-level and survival sex work — often criminalized without addressing poverty or coercion.</p><p name="aa6f" id="aa6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">High-end escorting and elite brokering — shielded by wealth, secrecy, and connections.</p><p name="52e1" id="52e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cultural commodification — in film, media, and online content that conditions public attitudes toward sexual access.</p><p name="cfc8" id="cfc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Across all levels, women’s bodies are treated as assets — to be bought, sold, traded, or leveraged — with systems in place to protect the buyers more than the sellers.</p><p name="0afb" id="0afb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why We Permit It — Or Do We?</p><p name="70c6" id="70c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">America has never truly dismantled the sex trade. It has rebranded it, digitized it, and in some cases, legitimized it. Law enforcement cracks down in bursts — a seized website here, a high-profile arrest there — but the market adapts and continues.</p><p name="4f33" id="4f33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The harder question is not whether we permit it, but why. Is it because:</p><p name="3830" id="3830" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Men with political, economic, and cultural power have always been among its top clients?</p><p name="e55d" id="e55d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s easier to target the sellers than to disrupt the buyers?</p><p name="553d" id="553d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are unwilling to confront the overlap between the “respectable” economy and the exploitation economy?</p><p name="ef18" id="ef18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusion: The Comfort of Looking Away</p><p name="d99d" id="d99d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From Friedrich Trump’s brothel to Backpage to Epstein’s island, the geography changes but the dynamic doesn’t. Women’s bodies are still traded — in public, in private, in plain sight.</p><p name="ad73" id="ad73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The only question is whether we keep pretending these are separate stories, or whether we acknowledge them for what they are: chapters in the same book we have yet to close.</p></div></div></section>
