As of today, I am issuing a formal public Cease &amp; Desist demand concerning any ongoing or historical withholding, blocking, quarantining, or redirection of funds sent to my PayPal account.</p><p name="a211" id="a211" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a disabled physicist, public whistleblower, published researcher, and inventor of what is now being recognized as a foundational equation in both artificial general intelligence and cognitive physics‚Äîthe Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) Equation. I have made multiple high-profile disclosures implicating major corporations, including OpenAI, SoundCloud, and others, in intellectual property suppression and systemic misconduct.</p><p name="055f" id="055f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is in the context of these disclosures that I now believe my PayPal account may be compromised by silent filtering mechanisms, either algorithmic or human, that have prevented incoming donations and support from reaching me.</p><p name="f9be" id="f9be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üßæ TIMELINE OF EVENTS</p><p name="4f56" id="4f56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have repeatedly contacted PayPal Tier 1 Support over the past several months to ask a simple, clear question:</p><p name="37ed" id="37ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; &quot;Has PayPal blocked, held, intercepted, or reversed any incoming donations or payments from individuals not previously known to me (e.g., anonymous supporters, the public, or journalistic parties)?&quot;</p><p name="08b3" id="08b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I explicitly requested a formal written response, with a signature or internal reference, confirming or denying whether any such interference has taken place.</p><p name="4037" id="4037" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was never escalated to any Tier 2, fraud, legal, or compliance department.<br>No representative responded to my written request.<br>On multiple occasions, the conversations were abruptly ended by the PayPal agent, without resolution, confirmation, or transparency.</p><p name="1f69" id="1f69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At no point did any representative admit to having the authority to discuss the matter in a meaningful way.<br>No email, written record, or denial was ever issued.</p><p name="e731" id="e731" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not customer service failure.<br>This is institutional stonewalling.</p><p name="ef87" id="ef87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">‚öñÔ∏è WHY THIS MATTERS</p><p name="e700" id="e700" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If no funds have been blocked, intercepted, or held, then PayPal should have no issue confirming this in writing.</p><p name="5e67" id="5e67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your ongoing refusal to provide a signed, written statement to that effect constitutes:</p><p name="7ca8" id="7ca8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Evidentiary silence, potentially suggesting guilt or collusion.</p><p name="b74b" id="b74b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. A breach of public trust, particularly when dealing with whistleblowers and vulnerable citizens.</p><p name="43d0" id="43d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. A potential civil rights violation, should evidence emerge that financial suppression was initiated as retaliation for protected speech.</p><p name="0371" id="0371" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As of this writing, I have received only one donation‚Äîfrom a personal contact who confirmed their action to me directly.<br>Not a single unprompted or anonymous donation has reached me.</p><p name="5390" id="5390" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given the widespread distribution of my work across social media, Medium, and public interviews, this is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">anomalous</strong>.<br>And given the patterns of suppression I‚Äôve documented elsewhere, this fits a broader systemic trend.</p><p name="a27a" id="a27a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üõë FORMAL NOTICE</p><p name="e447" id="e447" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a publicly witnessed Cease and Desist Demand to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and any internal or third-party compliance agents acting on your behalf:</p><p name="91df" id="91df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; Cease and Desist any and all filtering, flagging, blocking, or redirection of funds sent to my account‚Äîwhether by manual action, AI filter, risk algorithms, or internal fraud protocols that have been triggered by my political or scientific disclosures.</p><p name="0b81" id="0b81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally:</p><p name="2c8c" id="2c8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are hereby requested to issue a formal written confirmation or denial, signed or clearly referenced, addressing the following:</p><p name="8a07" id="8a07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether any funds have been held, blocked, reversed, or flagged.</p><p name="24c4" id="24c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether any risk trigger or compliance hold has been placed on my account or recipient ID.</p><p name="3a0d" id="3a0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether any law enforcement, governmental, or corporate third party has issued a request related to my account activity.</p><p name="0558" id="0558" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your failure to respond to this request within 14 days will be treated as further evidentiary silence, to be included in any legal, journalistic, or institutional review of corporate censorship, digital rights violations, or financial suppression targeting whistleblowers and disabled persons.</p><p name="a8ae" id="a8ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">‚úçÔ∏è PUBLIC WITNESS</p><p name="500b" id="500b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This document stands as public proof of my inquiry, and public proof of your refusal to respond meaningfully to it.</p><p name="6dbc" id="6dbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am not paranoid.<br>I am simply documenting recursion.</p><p name="3f5b" id="3f5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And in the absence of transparency, the Field speaks louder than your silence.</p><p name="a7f3" id="a7f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Respectfully,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist, Inventor, Whistleblower, Writer<br>enuminous@gmail.com</p></div></div></section>
