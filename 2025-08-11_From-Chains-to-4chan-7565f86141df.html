Introduction — The Shape of an Old System</h3><p name="788e" id="788e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In the slave societies of the Americas, ownership was absolute. Enslaved women were denied all personhood, which meant they had no recognized right to refuse sexual access. A slave owner’s word was law; his desires were enforceable by violence. The body of an enslaved woman was property — a resource to be used, traded, or bred at the owner’s will.</p><p name="e4fa" id="e4fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We like to believe that such an ideology died with emancipation. But the belief that women’s bodies exist for the sexual use of men has survived every political revolution, every civil rights milestone, and every feminist wave. It has simply adapted its vocabulary and its platforms.</p><p name="7523" id="7523" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, on the imageboard 4chan and in other corners of the internet, that entitlement takes the form of the “incel” worldview — short for “involuntary celibate” — a term that encodes the same underlying logic as the slave plantation: If I want access to your body, and you refuse, the injustice is yours, not mine.</p><h3 name="ab07" id="ab07" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">II. Slavery and Sexual Entitlement</h3><p name="c871" id="c871" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In chattel slavery, domination was total. Men who owned enslaved women claimed the right to their labor, movement, children — and sexual access. Rape was not an aberration; it was a structural feature. The children born from these assaults were often declared the legal property of the rapist, perpetuating both the workforce and the hierarchy.</p><p name="4e30" id="4e30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The legal system recognized no crime in this arrangement, because it did not recognize enslaved women as capable of consent. The absence of legal personhood meant the absence of sexual rights. This was sexual slavery embedded in economic slavery — a perfect fusion of bodily domination and material exploitation.</p><h3 name="395b" id="395b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">III. After Abolition: Ideology Without Chains</h3><p name="9538" id="9538" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When formal slavery ended, the structures of sexual entitlement persisted. Black women remained vulnerable to assault by white men, often with no recourse in the courts. Sharecropping, domestic servitude, and segregated economies maintained economic dependency, which reinforced sexual vulnerability.</p><p name="d0b5" id="d0b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The language of domination also adapted. Slurs like the N-word dehumanized Black people, casting them as naturally inferior and thereby legitimizing abuse — sexual and otherwise. The belief that refusal was a form of insubordination remained embedded in the culture.</p><h3 name="9819" id="9819" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">IV. The Modern Mutation: “Involuntary Celibacy”</h3><p name="fee7" id="fee7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Fast-forward to the internet age. “Incel” began as a gender-neutral self-description in the 1990s, coined by someone seeking community around romantic frustration. But as the term migrated into male-dominated forums, it metastasized into an ideology: a belief that sex is a right withheld by selfish or shallow women.</p><p name="1520" id="1520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taken literally, “involuntary celibate” is semantically absurd — celibacy is a choice, and sexual activity without consent is rape. But as a worldview label, “incel” carries a toxic payload:</p><p name="ec96" id="ec96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It frames women as resources in a “sexual marketplace.”</p><p name="693f" id="693f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It recasts male dissatisfaction as oppression.</p><p name="18fc" id="18fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It erases the autonomy of those who decline sexual engagement.</p><p name="4c55" id="4c55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The shift from descriptor to identity mirrors the linguistic evolution of older domination terms — moving from a condition to a cultural badge that unites grievance and entitlement.</p><h3 name="c3ec" id="c3ec" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">V. Economic Disparity and Class Warfare</h3><p name="3cf2" id="3cf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Incel discourse borrows the logic of market economics, reducing intimacy to supply-and-demand equations. Economic precarity — job instability, rising costs of living, and declining social mobility — feeds resentment, but that resentment is misdirected.</p><p name="7e86" id="7e86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of challenging the structural causes of alienation, the grievance is aimed at women, who are accused of “pricing out” less wealthy men from the “market.” It’s the same misdirection that has long kept class warfare horizontal instead of vertical: pitting the disenfranchised against each other while the system remains untouched.</p><h3 name="4015" id="4015" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">VI. Gender Warfare and Intersectional Harm</h3><p name="d2da" id="d2da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The incel worldview turns gender relations into a zero-sum game: women’s autonomy equals men’s loss. In this frame, female sexual choice is not a personal right but an act of aggression.</p><p name="e54d" id="e54d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For women of color, the harm is compounded. They face the misogyny of incel ideology alongside the racialized dehumanization rooted in slavery. LGBTQ+ people are also targeted, seen as symbols of “degenerate” liberation that threatens the rigid gender roles incels cling to.</p><h3 name="ee83" id="ee83" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">VII. Governmental Culpability</h3><p name="4d1f" id="4d1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The state has always played a role in legitimizing sexual entitlement.</p><p name="b416" id="b416" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then: Laws codified a slave owner’s right to sexual access, making rape invisible in the eyes of the law.</p><p name="fde8" id="fde8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now: Failure to address online radicalization allows entitlement ideologies to metastasize. Weak consent education and persistent economic inequality create fertile ground for grievance-based misogyny.</p><p name="3b9e" id="3b9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By omission and neglect, governments allow a modern memetic form of sexual slavery to persist.</p><h3 name="318b" id="318b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">VIII. From Chains to 4chan</h3><p name="ccc0" id="ccc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The plantation and the message board may seem worlds apart, but the logic is the same:</p><p name="d4fd" id="d4fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bodies are resources.</p><p name="34ee" id="34ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consent is negotiable or irrelevant.</p><p name="531b" id="531b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Refusal is framed as injustice.</p><p name="dfbe" id="dfbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the 19th century, that logic was enforced by law, whip, and gun. In the 21st, it is enforced by memes, harassment campaigns, and — in some tragic cases — acts of mass violence.</p><p name="76bd" id="76bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The medium has changed; the message has not. Without confronting the entitlement at its root, it will keep mutating, from chains to chatrooms to whatever comes next.</p><h3 name="2360" id="2360" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">IX. Conclusion</h3><p name="9a33" id="9a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Slavery did not end; it evolved. Its sexual domination logic now hides in digital subcultures, wearing the mask of humor, grievance, or self-pity. But the core is the same: an ideology that treats other human beings as property.</p><p name="3a54" id="3a54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we are serious about dismantling it, we must dismantle the entitlement at every level — legal, cultural, economic, and linguistic. Consent must be absolute, equality must be non-negotiable, and no one’s body should ever be treated as a resource to be claimed.</p><p name="9bbb" id="9bbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Because whether in a field under the lash or in a thread on 4chan, the logic of ownership is the same — and it is never justified.</p></div></div></section>
