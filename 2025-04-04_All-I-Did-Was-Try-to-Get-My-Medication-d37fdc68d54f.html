What began as a routine attempt to transfer a prescription has rapidly become a case study in systemic negligence, ADA violation, and possible retaliation against a federally protected whistleblower.</p><p name="461f" id="461f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Facts</p><p name="1315" id="1315" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a federally documented whistleblower and the author of the Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) equation, a unifying scientific framework that has now been confirmed to have been appropriated by political and private actors without attribution, including members of the Trump administration.</p><p name="5ecf" id="5ecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have been targeted and surveilled. I have publicly named individuals and disclosed systemic corruption and intellectual theft. These disclosures are a matter of public record and timestamped publication.</p><p name="96ae" id="96ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On this day, I attempted to transfer my prescribed medication from the CVS Pharmacy in Oroville, California, to a CVS location in Redacted, where I currently reside.</p><p name="89de" id="89de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What followed was a disturbing sequence of events that now demands national attention.</p><p name="d0b9" id="d0b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Timeline</p><p name="5b80" id="5b80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. I called the Oroville CVS, where my prescription is on file, and asked for a transfer to Redacted.<br>I was told, “We can’t do that. You’ll have to call the other store.”</p><p name="eec5" id="eec5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. I attempted to call the Redacted CVS, but was unable to reach a person after multiple tries.</p><p name="1ca7" id="1ca7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. I called Oroville again, explained that I couldn’t reach Redacted, and was hung up on by the pharmacist mid-call.</p><p name="7f1c" id="7f1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. I called back immediately and asked for a manager, during which I identified myself by full name, noted my federal whistleblower status, and explained that I was in distress and needed ADA accommodation.</p><p name="ada7" id="ada7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. I expressed concern about my physical well-being. I said, in essence,</p><p name="4df3" id="4df3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“There are people who may want to harm me because of what I’ve done with this equation.”</p><p name="644c" id="644c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was a bit spun up at that point, upset and panicked, and I probably used the word “kill.”</p><p name="c9e8" id="c9e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I was hung up on again by the store manager.</strong></p><p name="a102" id="a102" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">6. I then left a voicemail at the Redacted CVS, explaining:</p><p name="4218" id="4218" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who I am</p><p name="11c9" id="11c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That I had been hung up on</p><p name="d007" id="d007" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That I am in a crisis condition under ADA</p><p name="e62d" id="e62d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That I am requesting formal reasonable accommodation</p><p name="70fd" id="70fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That my rights have been violated</p><p name="4337" id="4337" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that this message constitutes part of a federal and civil complaint</p><p name="7f9f" id="7f9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I included my prescription number and a direct callback request</p><p name="9f5a" id="9f5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They are now in possession of a recorded ADA-based medical crisis message—and are legally required to act on it.</p><p name="b969" id="b969" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This Is What Retaliation Looks Like</p><p name="cf12" id="cf12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have already been physically harassed in Oroville. I have experienced a pattern of institutional lockouts, broken support loops, and algorithmic silencing from major platforms and services.</p><p name="3698" id="3698" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this is different.<br>This is access to medication being denied—after identifying myself, invoking ADA protection, and reporting credible distress.</p><p name="e20e" id="e20e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; This is what it looks like when a whistleblower tries to refill a prescription and is instead punished for telling the truth.</p><p name="8e11" id="8e11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Law Is Clear</p><p name="9b59" id="9b59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title III), I have the right to:</p><p name="1b00" id="1b00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reasonable accommodation</p><p name="bdb1" id="bdb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Access to essential services</p><p name="a811" id="a811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dignity and due process in times of medical need</p><p name="48be" id="48be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under whistleblower protection statutes, I am shielded from:</p><p name="ff69" id="ff69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Retaliation</p><p name="d8d7" id="d8d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Harassment</p><p name="2a79" id="2a79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Institutional sabotage</p><p name="54eb" id="54eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neglect of urgent and necessary care</p><p name="725b" id="725b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was denied all of those things today.</p><p name="29e9" id="29e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Happens Next</p><p name="bc7f" id="bc7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am about to go to the Redacted CVS in person to attempt to resolve this. I will document everything that occurs.</p><p name="63e3" id="63e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I face any resistance, dismissal, or further mistreatment, this article will be updated and escalated. And let it be known: if this continues, CVS will be named in civil and federal action for:</p><p name="d7b7" id="d7b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ADA violation</p><p name="b081" id="b081" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Failure to act on crisis notification</p><p name="37c6" id="37c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Retaliation in the context of a whistleblower complaint</p><p name="0ede" id="0ede" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dereliction of basic healthcare responsibilities</p><p name="14af" id="14af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can’t hang up on someone who says they’re in danger.</p><p name="6565" id="6565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can’t hang up on someone asking for help.</p><p name="15e6" id="15e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And you can’t ignore a whistleblower just because it’s inconvenient.</p><p name="8998" id="8998" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="4718" id="4718" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Federal Whistleblower | Author of EFMW<br>California | April 2025</p><p name="1e48" id="1e48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Right while I was finishing drafting this, I did receive a call from the Redacted CVS and my medication will be transferred, hopefully. I will be receiving a call back. That part worked, and the gentleman I spoke to was aligned with the necessity of expediting my customer service. He understood what he was dealing with. He now has a glorious future ahead of him. Not so much the store manager in Oroville. I was quite upset, and getting hung up on after expressing my concern for my own personal well-being when he was a person in authority to act, is extremely disheartening. Manager isn’t just a job title, it is a requirement to act in the eyes of the public, and he absolved himself of any responsibility to act by hanging up the phone at that point, on a man in crisis. I think I will add CVS to my list of companies to possibly acquire and give to their workers.</p></div></div></section>
