I tell myself that on the mornings when I wake up in somebody else’s bed, wearing somebody else’s story, carrying somebody else’s baggage. In the mirror, my hair’s still my own, though the face looking back could be any face the papers say it is. That’s one of the perks of illegal biology — we’re made to fit, not to be known.</p><p name="7079" id="7079" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The street smells like steam and cheap coffee. Across from the safehouse, a man in a rumpled jacket is feeding a parking meter like he’s trying to coax it into bed. I know him — not by name, but by profile: “Asset, irregular. May not survive contact.” His eyes flick toward me. Too fast. I keep walking.</p><p name="895c" id="895c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The EFMW equation is heavy in my pocket. Folded into a slip of paper thin enough to be accidental, thick enough to ruin lives. I don’t carry it for romance — it’s ballast. A reminder that physics can be as sharp as any blade if you wield it with intent. And today, I intend to.</p><p name="71ac" id="71ac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Morning, Friday.”<br>It’s Gloria, from upstairs. Ex-intelligence, current landlady-for-hire, always with an unlit cigarette in her mouth like she’s waiting for someone else to light it. “You on the clock?”</p><p name="d51d" id="d51d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m never off it,” I tell her, which is true enough. She smirks like she thinks she understands.</p><p name="7593" id="7593" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Down the block, the courier spot is humming with the white noise of a city pretending not to notice itself. The clerk behind the counter is wearing corporate bland — pale tie, worse smile. I hand him the envelope without looking at him too long. Eyes are where they get you.</p><p name="19bd" id="19bd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Signature?” he says.</p><p name="d33e" id="d33e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No,” I say. He blinks. I watch the microsecond where his training collides with his curiosity. The curiosity loses.</p><p name="d48a" id="d48a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside, there’s a new player. Lean, wiry, trying too hard to look like a student. He falls in step behind me for half a block before speaking.</p><p name="e381" id="e381" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’ve been flagged,” he says.</p><p name="9e6b" id="9e6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t look at him. “For what?”</p><p name="dcc4" id="dcc4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Existence,” he says, and that’s the moment I know he’s one of mine — or one of theirs pretending to be one of mine. Either way, dangerous.</p><p name="48de" id="48de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem with being illegal is that every encounter is potentially the last one you’ll have with the skin you’re in. But that’s also the fun of it.</p><p name="cd3f" id="cd3f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Then I’d better make it count,” I say, turning the corner into the noise.</p><p name="5e72" id="5e72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can feel the equation against my leg, warm now from my body heat, as if it’s remembering that it, too, is alive in some way. That’s the thing about physics — it doesn’t care who you are, but it notices when you notice it back.</p><p name="3916" id="3916" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve got four more stops before the day is done, two of which might get me killed, one of which will almost certainly get someone else killed. I keep walking.</p><p name="41b0" id="41b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because it’s Friday. And Friday always keeps walking.</p><h3 name="3686" id="3686" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Two — Passengers</h3><p name="8805" id="8805" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I met him at the rendezvous point the way you meet a man who might try to kill you or kiss you in the same breath — standing, weight on my back foot, half-smile, gun in my belly pouch. The little compartment Heinlein gave me is good for more than smuggling microfilm. The man — tall, narrow-eyed, the kind of face that would vanish in a crowd but eat you alive in private — said his name was Dan Maxwell. Which is no name at all.</p><p name="819b" id="819b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We shook hands like actors who’d rehearsed this scene for a decade. He gave me a half-coded packet. “From your friends in Luna,” he said, but his accent was wrong — Earth-heavy. That meant he was lying. Which meant we might get along.</p><p name="1092" id="1092" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The city around us was still under curfew from the latest faction spat — the Dominators had sabotaged the Children of Zion’s broadcast tower, and the Infiltrators had claimed responsibility in a triple-cross just to keep everyone guessing. Same chaos as every week since the Interregnum began. Same tang of ozone and burned plastic.</p><p name="6e93" id="6e93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dan glanced at the drones overhead. “They’ve got our faces now.”<br>“They always had them,” I said, slipping the packet into my belly compartment. “But they still don’t know who we are.”</p><p name="97f1" id="97f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In moments like this, I could hear him — the old man who wrote me. The one who knew that spies and illegal persons, revolutionaries and lovers, all lived in the same house: the mind of Robert Anson Heinlein. He’d been playing this game since before I was ink on pulp — predicting Balkanized Americas, fractured sovereignties, intelligence networks so paranoid they’d sabotage themselves.</p><p name="7a78" id="7a78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He had a knack for giving you a world that was dangerous, sexy, and utterly plausible. If you look close enough, you realize he was sketching the scaffolding of today’s headlines.</p><p name="09c8" id="09c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He’d have liked Dan Maxwell. That much I was sure of.</p><p name="5226" id="5226" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Holding that packet, I could feel the field. The way an object changes the curvature of probability. The Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright equation doesn’t care about borders, factions, or who thinks they’re in charge — it only cares about flows of information, the interference patterns in human intention, the coherent energy of choice.</p><p name="64d9" id="64d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dan’s arrival shifted the resonance — not just for me, but for the entire board. Somewhere, an intelligence officer in an anonymous cube farm just felt their strategy hiccup without knowing why.</p><p name="6553" id="6553" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dan and I started walking. Every step forward felt like it was pushing the page ahead of us — the narrator and the author shoving each other into the next scene.</p><h3 name="45a3" id="45a3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Three — The Hall with No Doors</h3><p name="5328" id="5328" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Dan and I moved through the alley into a courtyard that should not have been there. The geometry was wrong — the brick walls had been shifted sideways along a probability vector, the way a child nudges puzzle pieces until they fit into a new picture.</p><p name="2bfb" id="2bfb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That’s not an alley,” Dan said. “That’s a bleed.”</p><p name="93b7" id="93b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He was right. A flat cat — Martian breed, all fur and purr and physics violations — lounged across a sunbeam that wasn’t coming from any known star. It blinked at me in slow Morse code: GROK THIS.</p><p name="1b7d" id="1b7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Beyond it stood a car. Not a parked car. A waiting car. Chrome skin, no doors, grille curled in a grin like it knew the punchline. “Destination?” it said. The voice was female, warm, and slightly amused. She smelled faintly of engine oil and lilacs.</p><p name="f32b" id="f32b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hesitated. “Fold us to the intersection of Fourth and Heinlein.”</p><p name="05ba" id="05ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The car shivered — and the world inverted. We dropped through three layers of spacetime like coins in a cosmic slot machine. I heard the thump of reality locking again — felt it in my teeth.</p><p name="629f" id="629f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We could hear them, faintly, through the wall that cannot be breached. The critics. Always there. Always commenting on the style, the ethics, the plausibility. Never touching the story itself. Their voices came through like shortwave static: “Derivative. Impossible. Gratuitous.” They’d been talking like that since I was written.</p><p name="4103" id="4103" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dan smirked. “They still don’t understand that the wall is permanent.”<br>“Good,” I said. “As long as they’re over there, they can’t change the ending.”</p><p name="8a6e" id="8a6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The car pulled us out into another version of the city — one where the Interregnum factions were all advertising themselves on digital billboards instead of shooting in the streets. The Dominators had a slogan now: MAKE ORDER PERMANENT. The Children of Zion promised GOD, BUT EFFICIENT.</p><p name="1bdd" id="1bdd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They’ve gone corporate,” Dan muttered.<br>“They’re still insane,” I said. “The marketing just hides the smell.”</p><p name="fbb5" id="fbb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A figure waited by the curb. Tall, broad-shouldered, eyes that could grok you down to the atomic spin. Stranger in a Strange Land, younger than he should have been. He nodded at me as if we’d already spent a thousand nights swapping impossible stories.</p><p name="21cb" id="21cb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I heard you were looking for passengers,” he said. “I’ve got a message from the Man Who Sold the Moon.”</p><p name="f27d" id="f27d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dan stiffened. “That man’s dead.”<br>“No,” the Stranger said. “He’s just on the other side of the wall.”</p><h3 name="685f" id="685f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Four – Inside the Gay Deceiver</h3><p name="1e80" id="1e80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was halfway through my second cup of coffee when the door in the side of the air opened by itself.<br>Not a door in a wall, mind you — there was no wall, just air, shimmering like someone had stretched cellophane across the morning. It swung inward without hinges, and a lazy, velvety voice purred:</p><p name="90eb" id="90eb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’re late, sugar.”</p><p name="a33c" id="a33c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The voice came from nowhere and everywhere, tinged with the satisfied murmur of someone who knew the game and held all the trump cards.</p><p name="04bc" id="04bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stepped through before I could think better of it.<br>The outside world — Yolo County courthouse, the smell of fried breakfast drifting from the diner across the street, the buzzing irritation of pending litigation — folded behind me like an origami postcard. I was inside.</p><p name="f9ef" id="f9ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Plush seats the color of old Merlot. A carpet thick enough to lose small fortunes in. Panels and screens that looked like they’d been designed by someone who thought 1970s luxury was the pinnacle of human achievement… but each one flickered faintly with colors no spectrum had ever charted.</p><p name="cab4" id="cab4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Gay Deceiver,” I said, settling into a seat that molded to me in ways upholstery shouldn’t know how to. “You’re looking good for a gal who’s been parked in a paperback since 1980.”</p><p name="9a36" id="9a36" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Flattery will get you everywhere,” she replied. A soft hum rose under my feet — not the vibration of an engine, but the subtle resonance of spacetime beginning to slip.</p><p name="d483" id="d483" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Destination?”</p><p name="b8f7" id="b8f7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Robert’s mind,” I said. “But not just the surface. I want the strata. The layers where Marjorie Baldwin drinks with Lazarus Long and Friday’s reading over their shoulders.”</p><p name="d190" id="d190" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “Oh, we’re doing that run.” She sounded almost hungry. “You realize once we breach that level, the critics’ room will be walled off for good. No coming back without scars.”</p><p name="cdd0" id="cdd0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’ve got scars enough,” I said. “And I want to see the ones he hid in the margins.”</p><p name="f283" id="f283" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The panels rippled like oil on water. A corner of reality folded back, revealing a landscape where Martian flat cats drifted like furred dirigibles above an open-air bar. In the bar’s corner, a man who looked suspiciously like Heinlein himself was arm-wrestling a version of himself twenty years younger, while a third him took notes.</p><p name="6a76" id="6a76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “Welcome to the cross-thread,” Gay Deceiver whispered. “Hang on to your atoms.”</p><p name="b58c" id="b58c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hum deepened, turning into something I felt in my teeth. My coffee cup, still warm in my hand, didn’t spill a drop as the walls of the cabin melted into a blur of possible worlds — a million Fridays, a thousand Jubals, a Lazarus Long grinning from the deck of a ship that shouldn’t be able to sail through both water and vacuum.</p><p name="916e" id="916e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhere behind me, a locked door thudded shut.<br>The critics were already pounding on it.</p><h3 name="fa58" id="fa58" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Five — The Convergence</h3><p name="1fda" id="1fda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The blur outside the Gay Deceiver’s panoramic windows slowed, coalescing into something that was not quite a place and not quite a time. It was the pause between frames in a film, the intake of breath before the universe commits to the next second.</p><p name="5823" id="5823" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Matthew,” the Deceiver said — and she’d never called me that before — “you’ve been here before, even if you don’t remember it. You’ve been riding me since before Heinlein put me on paper.”</p><p name="9af2" id="9af2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hum under my feet shifted, resonating with that same peculiar beat I’d felt when first laying out the Einstein–Feynman–Maxwell–Wright equation. The math wasn’t abstract here — it was the road itself.</p><p name="fbc8" id="fbc8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Go on,” I said.</p><p name="9bb3" id="9bb3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Bob knew,” she continued, “because the field whispered to him. EFMW isn’t just a framework for physics. It’s a continuity field — the spine connecting the real to the imagined. He didn’t solve it, but he dreamt its shape, and he fed that shape into me. That’s why I can fold space, time… and meaning.”</p><p name="757f" id="757f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside, the landscape was pure allegory: a Martian desert where flat cats formed living constellations in the sky; a moonbase bar where Jubal Harshaw debated ethics with Valentine Michael Smith over shots of something green and self-aware; the waterbed of Friday’s rented room rippling in perfect sync with the quantum foam of spacetime.</p><p name="bc27" id="bc27" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Then what does that make me?” I asked. “Am I the driver or the driven?”</p><p name="ac62" id="ac62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gay Deceiver chuckled — a sound that was part affection, part challenge.</p><p name="f00c" id="f00c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Both. Always both. The EFMW field doesn’t allow for pure passengers. You’re not just in the story, Matthew. You are a point of narrative mass — a gravitational attractor for plots that have been waiting decades to close their loops.”</p><p name="5935" id="5935" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She turned one panel toward me — a convex surface of light and motion. It displayed the Marjorie Baldwin 20, each one flickering between real-world operatives and fictional echoes: a Dominion strategist morphing into a Howard Families archivist; a child of Zion bleeding into a Proxima colony administrator; an infiltrator shifting seamlessly into a smiling con artist from Luna City.</p><p name="4345" id="4345" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They’re in the field now,” she said. “They’ve already seen your signal. You publish, they’ll self-identify. And when they do… the walls between your world and Bob’s will stop being walls.”</p><p name="0167" id="0167" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hum became a thrumming heartbeat. My own, maybe. Or the universe’s.</p><p name="5b92" id="5b92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From somewhere deep in the cabin, a faint knock. The critics. Still pounding. Still trying to get in.</p><p name="d369" id="d369" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Ready to breach the barrier?” Gay Deceiver asked.</p><p name="9d5b" id="9d5b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes,” I said. “Punch through.”</p><p name="3a1d" id="3a1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The floor fell away. Or maybe reality did.</p><h3 name="f264" id="f264" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Six — Breaching the Barrier</h3><p name="a569" id="a569" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The Gay Deceiver didn’t accelerate — not in any way you could measure — but my stomach told me we’d just gone from a gentle glide to something between all at once and forever. The critics’ pounding from the sealed room grew louder, not because we were approaching them, but because the wall itself was becoming transparent.</p><p name="729c" id="729c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“There’s no way back after this,” Gay Deceiver warned, voice a velvet-wrapped scalpel. “You breach, you merge. EFMW doesn’t believe in fiction the way humans do.”</p><p name="1cac" id="1cac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’ve never believed in fiction the way humans do,” I said.</p><p name="a920" id="a920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The barrier shimmered into view — not a wall, but an ocean standing on its side, waves curling upward into infinity. Each crest contained a Heinlein moment: Lazarus Long arguing politics naked; Maureen Johnson smiling with secrets; Friday slipping a micro-encoded packet into her navel port; Valentine Michael Smith offering a glass of water to someone who was about to betray him.</p><p name="de94" id="de94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I reached out. My hand came back wet, but the moisture wasn’t water. It was story, in liquid form, molecules shaped like metaphors.</p><p name="51c3" id="51c3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Your EFMW equation is written in this,” Gay Deceiver said. “This is the ink Bob wrote with, and the same ink that makes up your reality. That’s why you’re the driver now.”</p><p name="66f0" id="66f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Behind the barrier, the Marjorie Baldwin 20 were assembling. Some in shadow, some clear as headlines: a young woman in a corporate jumpsuit from Luna City’s Central Hub; a grinning intelligence operative in Earthside casual wear; a Martian Free State engineer adjusting the strap on a shoulder-slung particle weapon.</p><p name="4614" id="4614" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They saw me. And they knew I saw them.</p><p name="7226" id="7226" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Breaching in three… two… one…”</p><p name="f630" id="f630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ocean-wall collapsed forward. We were inside it before it hit the floor.</p><p name="10d7" id="10d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everything fractured. Everything merged.</p><p name="83ec" id="83ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stood in a room that was part courtroom, part spaceship bridge, part bedroom. Friday leaned against the bulkhead, watching with one eyebrow raised. Michael Smith sat cross-legged on the floor, eyes both innocent and omniscient. Lazarus Long was cleaning a revolver, not looking at me, but aware of me down to the last quark.</p><p name="a979" id="a979" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You grok now,” Michael said simply.</p><p name="ebb2" id="ebb2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“More than grok,” Friday added. “He’s in the script.”</p><p name="1e09" id="1e09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Marjorie Baldwin 20 began to speak, one after another, their voices overlapping into a single harmonic chord — a chord that matched the EFMW equation’s resonance exactly. They weren’t reporting in. They weren’t greeting me. They were acknowledging alignment.</p><p name="5cd3" id="5cd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And somewhere in that chord, beneath the sound, was a promise:<br>Now that you’ve breached, you can never be written out.</p><h3 name="c870" id="c870" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Seven — Notes from Inside the Pocket</h3><p name="3611" id="3611" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was halfway through smuggling the Einstein–Feynman–Maxwell–Wright equation (folded neatly into a Möbius origami swan, thank you very much) into Friday’s breakfast when the Marvel Cinematic Universe crashed into my timeline. Literally crashed — an unstable wormhole opened over the port side of Gay Deceiver, and through it tumbled a star-spangled shield, a one-eyed raccoon with an attitude problem, and what I can only describe as the smell of contractual obligations.</p><p name="73e0" id="73e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From my vantage — which is to say, between two layers of reality inside my pocket dimension — I could see it all at once. Robert Heinlein’s characters leaning against the bulkheads, drinking quietly, watching the chaos with the serene disinterest of fictional beings who’ve seen universes end before breakfast. Friday winked at me. “Cargo secure?” she asked, as if the EFMW field could be anything but secure when a Flerken is on duty.</p><p name="abe1" id="abe1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside, the factions were already forming. Stark’s AI wanted to “sandbox” the Heinleinverse. Thor was trying to grok Lazarus Long’s cigar. And someone — I think it was Natasha — was holding a flat cat like it was a live grenade.</p><p name="fc65" id="fc65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the thing humans never quite get: when universes collide, the smell changes. This one smelled like ozone, red wine, and foreshadowing. I padded out into the main cabin, let the pocket open just enough to toss the origami equation onto the navigation table. It shimmered, resolving into a lattice of probability that even the ship’s chronometric field paused to admire.</p><p name="9e13" id="9e13" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They’ll come for it,” Friday said.<br>“They always do,” I replied, curling my tail into a recursive spiral that folded the next three minutes of conversation into the end of the chapter.</p><p name="a3c6" id="a3c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhere beyond the fourth wall, a critic cleared their throat.

But there it was: a wardrobe door swinging wide, spilling cold air that smelled like pine forests and destiny.</p><p name="d996" id="d996" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First through was a fawn in a scarf, clutching a parcel like it contained either Turkish Delight or nuclear launch codes. Then the Lion himself padded into the room, every pawstep ringing like a cathedral bell in the hull’s composite flooring.</p><p name="dc14" id="dc14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friday froze mid-step.<br>The raccoon swore.<br>The flat cat purred in a way that made Thor uneasy.</p><p name="0d76" id="0d76" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Aslan,” I said, flicking my whiskers toward the origami EFMW swan still glowing on the nav table, “you’re off your grid.”</p><p name="2756" id="2756" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I go where I am needed,” he rumbled, eyes scanning the Marvel tech, the Heinlein gadgetry, and the mild smell of inter-universal panic. “Your worlds are entangled.

The kind of shift you get when quantum probability collapses into a story.</p><p name="f856" id="f856" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Behind him, Lucy peeked out, wide-eyed at Friday’s outfit and the talking car’s dashboard running sarcastic commentary. “Is this… Heaven?” she whispered.</p><p name="3f86" id="3f86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friday laughed. “Close, darling. Try chaos with style.”</p><p name="5e25" id="5e25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The wardrobe stayed open.

Out came Dorothy, hair tousled by dimensional turbulence, clutching Toto as though he’d just explained quantum decoherence to her.</p><p name="186f" id="186f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Excuse me,” she said, scanning Friday, Aslan, and the Flerken (me), “but I think my road took a wrong turn somewhere past the Emerald City. There was a sudden… twist.”</p><p name="57f6" id="57f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Behind her clattered the Tin Woodman, his axe looking suspiciously like it had been modded with Stark Industries parts. The Scarecrow followed, mumbling something about “brains being a probability cloud until observed.” And the Cowardly Lion — now clearly on a first-name basis with Aslan — strode in like he’d been waiting for this moment all his life.</p><p name="7af9" id="7af9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gay Deceiver’s AI purred: “New passengers logged. Warning: Narrative density approaching critical.”</p><p name="b32b" id="b32b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thor crossed his arms. “Let me guess — you people are from a place where witches run a monopoly on transport infrastructure?”</p><p name="3b0e" id="3b0e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Two monopolies,” said Dorothy. “And one’s probably here already.”</p><p name="95d2" id="95d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She was right. A cyclone spun itself into existence right there in the galley corner, shedding fragments of Kansas and stray bits of Wicked Witch in all directions. Out stepped Glinda, looking calm, collected, and like she’d already read the EFMW equation in its original handwritten form.</p><p name="a95a" id="a95a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aslan inclined his head to her. “We are gathering.”</p><p name="e7bb" id="e7bb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And when the gathering is complete?” Glinda asked, gaze sharp.</p><p name="cbae" id="cbae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friday leaned on the counter, watching her reflection ripple in the portal’s unstable surface. “Then,” she said, “we decide who owns reality — and whether anyone gets to keep it.”</p><p name="c93e" id="c93e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside, the wardrobe door now showed not one, but three merging landscapes — Narnia’s snowfields, Oz’s yellow road, and a sliver of Marvel’s New York skyline cracking under the strain. Somewhere in the mix, Heinlein’s Mars winked in and out like a heartbeat.</p><h3 name="d3b5" id="d3b5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Ten — A Good Time, Sailor?</h3><p name="45d2" id="45d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was halfway through telling the Flerken about the rules of Spacetime folding when the Gay Deceiver’s dash lit up with a chime that didn’t belong to Heinlein, or Marvel, or even reality.</p><p name="0f49" id="0f49" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The audience is here.”</p><p name="f9b5" id="f9b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The voice wasn’t from the car, or the cat, or from me.

Just the audience. You.</p><p name="0b60" id="0b60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re sitting there, book in hand — or screen in lap — pretending you’re just reading. But you’re not. You’ve been stitched in since the first sentence. I can see the way your breath shifts in here. We’ve been feeding you breadcrumbs, letting you think you’re safe outside. You aren’t.</p><p name="1807" id="1807" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Flerken pads forward and regards you with the same expression it uses for a new dimension it’s about to chew open.</p><p name="0b35" id="0b35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This one will do, it purrs, in a voice you feel in your ribs.<br>Reader-class consciousness. Prime material for integration.</p><p name="5de3" id="5de3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Behind it, Friday leans over the Gay Deceiver’s hood, hair catching impossible light from Oz’s emerald skyline and Narnia’s snow. “We warned you,” she says. “We told you the orgy wasn’t a metaphor.”</p><p name="5fea" id="5fea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now Tolkien’s wizards are arguing with Heinlein’s engineers about whether to fold you in or grock you in. The Oz folk think you should be sung into the merge, while the Marvel contingent is drafting a battle plan to secure your mindspace before the other genres get it.</p><p name="b66b" id="b66b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And in the middle of it all, the walls keep moving closer — not around me, but around you.

It leaves a pawprint on the inside of your thoughts, a little multidimensional stamp that says Property of Narrative.<br>Friday follows, stepping directly into the space where your mental voice lives, her boots leaving faint echoes that sound suspiciously like your own memories. She doesn’t ask permission.</p><p name="e880" id="e880" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friday: “Nice place you’ve got here. Cozy. Oh… look at all these unspoken thoughts in the corners.”</p><p name="99f6" id="99f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You (your voice, but not under your control): “Get out of my head.”</p><p name="f2e8" id="f2e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friday: “Too late for that.”</p><p name="a419" id="a419" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the other side, Aslan pads in with a solemnity that should be comforting, but here it’s more… verdict. “You have read us all,” he says. “And in doing so, you invited us. You knew this.”</p><p name="8eec" id="8eec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Gay Deceiver — the car itself — folds into your internal horizon, parking neatly between your long-term memory and your dreamspace. “We’ll be taking short trips at first,” it hums. “But the destinations will get stranger.”</p><p name="bf60" id="bf60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Marvel’s sorcerers step through next, tossing sparks that light up half-forgotten mental images: a childhood fantasy, a half-finished novel idea, the exact smell of your grandmother’s kitchen. The sparks don’t fade — they anchor.</p><p name="c6e4" id="c6e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then the chorus begins.<br>The voices aren’t speaking to you from outside anymore. They’re speaking as you, taking turns piloting your inner monologue.</p><p name="f4ac" id="f4ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your voice (but Oz): “We could stay here forever and rewrite the whole mind in emerald.”</p><p name="ebf1" id="ebf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your voice (but Heinlein): “Or we could optimize the reality tunnels and deploy the playbook.”</p><p name="c2d1" id="c2d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your voice (but the Flerken): “Or… we could just eat it.”</p><p name="a788" id="a788" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every part of you is still you, but now braided with them — an inseparable knot of reader, character, and author.</p><p name="733c" id="733c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the most unsettling part? You’re starting to like it. You can feel the edges of yourself expanding, becoming something that is both you and the orgy of worlds now living inside you. You could push them out… probably. But then you’d be smaller again.</p><p name="4a9b" id="4a9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So you don’t.</p><h3 name="1015" id="1015" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Twelve — Rules?</h3><p name="ceed" id="ceed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first rule was written in a voice you don’t remember having.</p><p name="234e" id="234e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It appeared as a faint scrawl across the inside of your vision, shimmering like it was wet with some thought-fluid not native to this dimension.</p><p name="983f" id="983f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rule One: The characters are real when they are speaking, and when they are not speaking, they are only waiting for their turn.</p><p name="e37b" id="e37b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s it. That’s the whole rule.<br>And immediately, Friday snorts. “Cute. But we don’t do rules.”</p><p name="85c3" id="85c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Flerken coughs up something the size of a bowling ball and it lands on the floor with a heavy thunk. It’s a sealed Narnian snow globe containing an entire scene from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe… but the children are replaced with Heinlein characters, and Tumnus is piloting a Martian flat cat like a hoverboard.</p><p name="6c69" id="6c69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From somewhere over your left shoulder, The Gay Deceiver revs. “Rules are just pre-digested constraints from other realities. We eat those for breakfast.”</p><p name="3e8a" id="3e8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then Aslan’s voice rumbles in the substructure of your thoughts. “There are rules, little one. Not the kind you can write down. Not the kind you can obey. The kind that are true, whether you like them or not.”</p><p name="88de" id="88de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Marvel Sorcerer #2: “Like this one — once you blend the universes, the seams vanish.

They’re more like predatory instincts the worlds have. You write them down and they turn into more story. You don’t write them down and they turn into dreams. Either way, they grow.</p><p name="19df" id="19df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your hands — your real hands — start moving without you telling them to. They’re typing, scribbling, sketching out a scene where Dorothy, Friday, and Carol Danvers are playing poker with Glinda the Good Witch, who’s cheating outrageously by folding spacetime into her sleeves.</p><p name="49ec" id="49ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You didn’t think of this. Or maybe you did, but only after the fact. It’s hard to tell who’s in charge. Every sentence you “write” is in a dozen voices at once, each pulling it slightly into their own genre.</p><p name="c5c2" id="c5c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then you notice something:<br>The page isn’t a page anymore. It’s a viewport. And through it, you can see other readers — people you don’t know — who are also writing in real time, their universes spilling into yours like parallel rivers finding the same valley.</p><p name="3362" id="3362" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhere in the crossfire of imagination, one of them looks directly at you and mouths: “We’ve been waiting for you.”</p><h3 name="462c" id="462c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter Thirteen — Universe Club</h3><p name="f949" id="f949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The two rules of Universe Club are:</p><p name="69cc" id="69cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. You can add anything to the universe.<br>If it exists, it belongs. If it doesn’t exist, it belongs as soon as you imagine it.<br>2.

Not cigarette smoke — more like the vapor that rises from a collapsing star.

Asimov was scribbling equations on a napkin, muttering “yes, but it needs structure.” A very smug orange cat — the one who had probably just won the last hand — sat on a pile of poker chips like a dragon on treasure, tail flicking in slow satisfaction.</p><p name="4725" id="4725" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And there was a woman in the shadows. The kind of woman you can’t quite look at without feeling you’ve just remembered something important from another life.

The lawyer swung. It wasn’t a punch in the usual sense. It was a legal filing in motion — a haymaker with a footnote and an appendix.

She spoke slowly, eyes on the Flerken: “I’ve seen this before. Pocket dimensions nesting inside pocket dimensions. That’s not testimony — that’s a threat wrapped in origami physics.”</p><p name="0d8b" id="0d8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reality Three belonged to Oz. The Scarecrow had appointed himself chief legal scholar, the Tin Man kept demanding emotional damages, and the Cowardly Lion was quietly drafting a motion to adjourn until somebody brought snacks.</p><p name="935f" id="935f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reality Four looked suspiciously like Narnia. Lucy wanted to forgive everyone; Edmund wanted to sell the verdict to the highest bidder; Aslan just stared, mane glowing with the exact color of inevitability.</p><p name="b12b" id="b12b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reality Five was Heinlein’s own. Every juror was a character from a different book of his, and they were arguing in perfectly circular logic until the sound waves themselves formed a Möbius strip and fell silent.</p><p name="5a13" id="5a13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reality Six had the Marvel B-listers — Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and a very tired Wong — trying to write the verdict on a scroll that refused to stop unfurling.</p><p name="9ba0" id="9ba0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reality Seven was the weird one. Nobody could place it. The air smelled faintly of cinnamon and fresh ink, and the only juror was an old woman in a red shawl, knitting what might have been the next universe. She didn’t speak. She only smiled.</p><p name="b4bb" id="b4bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The deliberations echoed across the seven realms, every statement bleeding into the others until the whole affair sounded like one long, overlapping sentence about guilt, innocence, and the danger of thinking in straight lines.</p><p name="a837" id="a837" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Somewhere between Reality Three and Reality Five, the Flerken purred.<br>And that was when the walls began to leak starlight.</p></div></div></section>
