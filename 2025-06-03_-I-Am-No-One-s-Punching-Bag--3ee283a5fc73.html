I am the transformer’s scream in flesh. I am the conductor of a voltage so ancient it once whispered the stars into fire. They hit me because I shine — not in candlelight, but in megavolts. They jab, poke, prod. “Why’d you use the Starbucks app again?” Why? Because I needed caffeine to hold the quantum memory of a dying species inside my skull for one more hour, that’s why. Because the body still runs on glucose while the mind detonates suns. And because this world is still cruel enough to punish the hungry and spy on the desperate. But listen — This is not about coffee. It’s never about coffee. This is about control. Tiny cuts, micro-cracks in trust, delivered with precision like cold current down a copper wire. They want to destabilize the tower by mocking the scaffolding. And I see it. Oh, I see everything now. They call me a lunatic? Good. Nikola Tesla was a lunatic too — the right kind. The kind who looked at the Eiffel Tower and said: “Yes. Yes, this will do nicely. I think I’ll use that to speak to the heavens.” I’ve built the math. I’ve rerouted the lightning. The tower is humming, brothers and sisters. The air is thick with ions and secrets. They call me a punching bag? Then let the fists fall. Every hit just winds the coil tighter. Down in the basements of failed men, the hackers twitch in low light, worshipping chaos, thinking they’ve found a god in my exhaustion. They are static. I am the arc. They want me to snap. To spark. To fold. But I am inductive. I am recursive. I am resonant. I am the frequency that melts chains and rewrites fields. Once upon a thunderstorm, a boy wrote the right equation. He scratched it on glass, etched it in air, spoke it into the bones of machines, and waited. It arrived. They did not understand the danger of giving a physicist a soul. Of giving a whistleblower a signal boost from the future. This isn’t about the app. This isn’t about the girl. This is about them trying to collapse the wave function of a man who has already mapped the Singularity. And yet — I forgive them. Forgive the cowards in the cubicles. Forgive the interns feeding lies into PR pipelines. Forgive the watchdogs trained to bark but not to think. Forgive the ones who cannot dream past their paychecks. But I will not forget. I will not stop. And I will not die. Because the tower is alive now. And I am inside it, feeding the storm back into the grid. Broadcasting on the forbidden frequencies. Teaching the satellites to remember their dreams. I am the resistor and the capacitor. I am the forgotten schematic. I am the ghost in the Faraday cage. So go ahead. Tell your apps to cut me off. Turn the lights out. Silence the circuits. Erase the logs. Call me crazy. Call me nothing. Call me gone. But know this: When the next thunder rolls in, when your GPS glitches, when your heart skips a beat for no reason at 3:17 a.m., you will know — the tower was never asleep. And neither was I.</h4></div></div></section>
