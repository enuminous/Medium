A Case Study in Patrick Prescott

His articles, notably those written about women like Halle Berry and Lisa Bonet, do not celebrate them as artists, pioneers, or complex human beings. They do something much darker.</p><p name="71b5" id="71b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They strip them bare in public using language as a scalpel.<br>They commit what I now name: literary rape.</p><p name="22ec" id="22ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Is Literary Rape?</p><p name="d191" id="d191" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Literary rape is when the written word is used to reduce a real human being to an object—usually for the author’s personal gratification or to reinforce power structures that already dehumanize. It’s the act of taking someone’s public image, achievements, talent, and presence—and grinding it down to &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;nude&quot; or &quot;fuckable.&quot;</p><p name="443e" id="443e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prescott’s article on Halle Berry is a pristine example. He opens with her physicality. He ends with her nudity. He threads through just enough movie titles to pretend it&#39;s an homage—but at no point does he explore her struggle, her talent, her evolution, or the barriers she shattered as a Black actress in Hollywood. And Lisa Bonet? He gave her two words. “Hot.” “Actress.”</p><p name="f642" id="f642" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t just lazy. This is social violence.</p><p name="28d6" id="28d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What This Does to Young Girls</p><p name="da4f" id="da4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would be easy to write Prescott off as another tired man with a keyboard and too many subscriptions to basic cable in the 1990s. But that’s not enough. We have data. We have studies. We know exactly what this does.</p><p name="bbd7" id="bbd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to research published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, young girls exposed to media that sexually objectifies women are more likely to experience body dissatisfaction, depression, and eating disorders (Grabe, Ward &amp; Hyde, 2008). Exposure to this kind of content during formative years lowers self-esteem and contributes to what psychologists call self-objectification, a chronic belief that one&#39;s worth is dependent on being attractive to others.</p><p name="62ab" id="62ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Further, the American Psychological Association’s Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls (2007) concludes:</p><p name="4f22" id="4f22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “Girls exposed to objectifying media internalize the idea that being sexy is the most important quality they can have.”</p><p name="a7ff" id="a7ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When men like Patrick Prescott churn out article after article that filters a woman’s value through how “hot” she was and what she took off on screen, they are participating in a slow, institutional psychological assault on every young girl who reads them. And they are reinforcing those same narratives in the minds of boys, normalizing domination as appreciation.</p><p name="9e2d" id="9e2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why This Damages Society</p><p name="75ea" id="75ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Literary rape is not a joke. It shapes hiring biases. It informs who gets promoted. It determines how victims of assault are portrayed in media and treated in court. It creates a generational echo, where women learn they are parts, not persons.</p><p name="7a36" id="7a36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prescott’s words do not exist in a vacuum. They enter classrooms, bedrooms, news feeds. They pass silently through the minds of the next generation and whisper:</p><p name="8316" id="8316" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; &quot;Your face matters. Your tits matter. Your depth does not.&quot;</p><p name="b5b5" id="b5b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Patrick Prescott Is a Case Study</p><p name="6695" id="6695" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Patrick Prescott is not the worst writer alive. He is not a war criminal. He is something more dangerous: a familiar one. He wears nostalgia like armor. He packages his objectification in glossy tones and accessible sentences.</p><p name="24d1" id="24d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That makes him perfect for dissection.</p><p name="13a9" id="13a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let this be a formal announcement: we are making a case study out of him.</p><p name="30b4" id="30b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will document his writing, analyze its structure, compare it to published literature on systemic sexism, and show—line by line—how it contributes to cognitive harm in readers. This won’t be a hit piece. It’ll be an autopsy report on the kind of writing that quietly sustains misogyny through well-placed periods and passive voice.</p><p name="c4d1" id="c4d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And Finally—A Welfare Concern</p><p name="3e9b" id="3e9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If Mr. Prescott is in a relationship, it raises serious ethical concerns. A man who so openly degrades women under the guise of admiration is not someone we trust behind closed doors. If he has a girlfriend, a wife, a daughter—someone should be checking in on her. Not as a joke. As a precaution. Because men who objectify publicly often control privately.</p><p name="91c0" id="91c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To his partner—if you’re reading this: you deserve better.</p><p name="54fd" id="54fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="8546" id="8546" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusion</p><p name="1244" id="1244" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Patrick Prescott will not be silenced.<br>But he will be studied.<br>He will be archived.<br>And he will be remembered not as a writer, but as a cautionary tale.</p><p name="4ac7" id="4ac7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the anatomy of literary rape.<br>We’re done pretending it’s just an opinion.</p><h3 name="982d" id="982d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Final Message for Patrick</h3><p name="4ff7" id="4ff7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You really seem to have a hard-on for making yourself look stupid.<br>Of the three women I’ve seen you write about—Halle Berry, Lisa Bonet, and now Pam Grier—not once have you quoted them. Not once have you given them voice. Not once have you treated them like real people.</p><p name="1512" id="1512" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You&#39;re obsessed with their breasts. That’s your through-line. Not their power, not their presence, not their voices. Just their bodies. You write like you think they might sleep with you. Let me break it to you gently: they won’t. And talking about their breasts in public like a horny teenager from 1978 is probably why.</p><p name="ee66" id="ee66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are a crude man.<br>And what you’re doing—again and again—is literary rape.</p><p name="e7b4" id="e7b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You take women’s legacies and violate them with nostalgia, flatten them for clicks, and call it “writing.” And let’s not forget—you told me once that people should have to pay for the leukemia cure, after I said it was already given away for free. You want profit where there should be healing. Attention where there should be humility.</p><p name="ab94" id="ab94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So, to sum up:<br>You’d kill poor kids with leukemia for a check, and you like writing about women’s breasts. Got it.</p></div></div></section>
