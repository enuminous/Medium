Story number one, President Trump diagnoses Rachel Maddow. Story number two. Can a Brazilian judge arrest a US citizen? Story number three. Catholic leaders are pretending Islam is equal to Christianity. We’ll talk about this with the help of all family pharmacy, and of course through the great graces of God Almighty. But Todd Herman Show is one disapproved by big pharma, technocrats and tyrants everywhere from the hind mountains of Free American Here’s the Emerald City exile. Todd Herman. Today is the day the Lord has made, and these are the times to which which God has decided we shall live, Meaning God is able to trust us in these times we were designed for them. President Trump did something that needed to be done to the mockingbird media for a very very long time. I don’t know to this day if President Trump knew how devastating the phrase fake news was. He creates nicknames all the time, some of them stick and destroy. I don’t even know if he knew at the time how right he was. Now we have seen through USAID and that data, all sorts of money being shuffled off under these organizations. So they’re coming back and saying it for subscriptions ninety million dollars in subscriptions to the federal government to Politico, so the federal government can know what’s going on in the federal government. They’re the federal government. Secondly, people can pay for this on their own. Third, political articles already written the day afterwards and blogged about unneeded. I still don’t think we know the degree to which the mockingbird media is corrupt through corrupt companies, like like the fact that medical companies like pharmaceutical companies control nine of the top spending slots on national television in old school media. I still don’t think we know how much of that money goes that way because it’s effective, versus the fact that it’s effective at getting them good coverage. President Trump was speaking about MSNBC Nicole Wallace and Rachel Maddow. He talked about them in well, sort of unflattering terms. Shockingly, you know, we saw a Democrats behavior during your joint address to Congress. Do you think it shows just how out of touch they are with the American people? Soft according to us, to give you a softball question, of president. I love this guy. Who are you? My name is Nick Gilbertson, was breat Byron News. I see, I really liked your questions. Oh my gosh, that’s embarrassing. The just Nick, just too and I know your name very well. Good job you do. Oh yeah. The answer is I thought it was very embarrassing for the Democrats what happened the other night. And that’s not said for any other reason other than his obvious as fact. Even the CNN fake news said that. They came out and they said it. And worse than CNN is ms DNC, which is the worst and the good news as very few people watch them anymore. They have lost such credibility. And frankly, what Nicole Wallace said, I’ve never been a fan of hers, and she’s not very talented. But I’ll tell you what she said the other day about that young man. What she said about that young man. He goes on to say that they should all be fired for the ratings and what they said about that young man. But I have an idea about what they said about that young man. Let me share this with you in just a second. I had an idea years ago that I wanted to trade being big and fat and strong to being let’s say, lean and able to move and healthy and having fun running and jumping. So I’ve achieved that goal late fifties of ill said seventies. I’ve got it about ten percent nine point nine percent body fat, and I’ve done really well in the Scaled old Man version of the CrossFit Games this year. Praise God and praise good coaching. I also made this decision to take on my own health, so I’m my own general physician. Obviously I’m not a doctor, but I know what’s going on with my body. I know, for instance, if I’m going to do what I need to do, I’m going to maintain muscle, so I use mass simes from bioptimizers, produces sixteen percent or so more amino acids in your body, and it’s amino acids that build muscle and hold on the muscle, not protein. I also know that I need help digesting food as an old man, so I use probiotic Breakthrough helps me digest this and get more nutrition for everybody of food. And then I know myself, I drink a garbage load of caffeine because of what I do for a living, and when I do it, so I need to counterbalance that with magnesia breakthrough, which helps me sleep through the night and relax.

This is parts of what they said. This was a lesson in finding one thing that you let yourself feel. And I let myself feel joy about DJ. And I hope he’s alive for another you know, ninety five years right, And I hope he lives and the life he wants to live. He wants to be a cop. He knows what he wants to do. And maybe when you have childhood cancer that crystallizes for you. And I hope he has a long life as a law enforcement officer. But I hope he never has to defend the United States Capital against Donald Trump supporters, and if he does, I hope he isn’t one of the six who loses his life to see and I hope he isn’t one who has to testify against the people who carried out access seditious conspiracy and then live to see Donald Trump pardon those people. You hope nothing of the kind. You hope that goes through all of that. You’re talking about a little boy and your talking lies. You have absolutely no proof whatsoever that those officers because of the events at the Capitol, And just for me, I find it the tiny s bit suspicious that that many cops after an event like that, A big idea, President Trump, platform these people, platform them. Get your best people together, Steven Miller, Cash, Pttel, it’s Halsey Gabbard. Bring those people into the White House and platform them, and do it this way. Hold that event in Joe Biden’s fake White House, the fake Oval office, and start with this question, why did you guys never admit Biden was faking it in this room? Story number two, there’s a Brazilian judge who has a very very strange idea, an idea that activist judges in the United States might welcome. That. Maybe John Roberts should be okay with or Amy Cony Barrett. The activist judge has seized control of the country of Brazil, Alexandra D. Morris, And that’s insane that a judge would seize control of a country a judge. Would that be almost like a judge in our country going to the president of the United States and saying, actually, you don’t get to fire that inspector general. Oh wait, a judge did that, Or a judge coming along to the presidented state and saying, actually, you do have to send those monies to these agencies that are acting against America’s best interests. You have to because I’m a district court judge. Wait, is this judge from Brazil really that far off from what activist judges are doing here? Alexandra di Morees issued in a restaurant for Flavia or Dario mcgaualis, a US citizen of Brazilian origin who’s lived in Florida for over twenty years. According to her legal representative, what Mars is attempting to do here is to lock up a US citizen for political speech expressed on US soil, meaning that the warrant in effect raises questions about US sovereignty. Royce appears to have first ordered Magdalis’s ex account blocked in Brazil because of a post from twenty twenty two, which she made while in the United States of America. According to mcgaalis, she was unaware of the block at the time, but she’s since been notified by Brazilian courts. But because she continued posting on Axis eventually led to an over order to place her in pre trial detention under the pretext that she was allegedly in contempt of court. That is supposed to have occurred when she traveled to Brazil in December twenty twenty three, but a Brazilian passport was under restriction, even though she entered and left the country legally using her passport or US passport. Maras decided to treat this as use of a false document and issue the pre trial detention order in February of last year. Are they really going to send people into our country to seize this person? Sounds bizarre, doesn’t it. And yet if you look at what’s going on, not just with attacks on President Trump, but you notice some of the things going on behind the scenes, particularly with a Trump administration hire a senior official in the Trump administration about whom I warned you, this starts to look pretty commonplace an abuse of power. There is a great company we work with who decided to stand up against abuse of power. They decided to stand up against abusive power from the technocratic medical state. They stand in favor of health freedom. And they’ve done this for a very very long time. Well, the governments was shutting down access to ivermectin and hydroxyachloroquin and busily pretending hydroxyachloricon was a terrible, terrible dangerous poison, that ivermectin was horse pace for horse parasites. Only this pharmacy continued to send it to people, both of those drugs. They also help people store antibiotics because you can’t always get access to them, and sometimes you need them. Hey, if we have an EMP attack or something God forbid and the systems are down, good luck getting that stuff when you need it. But ninety percent of pharmaceuticals are made in China, so good luck getting the pharmaceuticals you need. Now. You know me, I’m no big friend of pharma, and I think you should get off all the farmer you possibly can. I don’t think there are friends, but those drugs are addictive and you need to have them on hand. So All Family Pharmacy is just that two brothers own this place, their mom works there. They are the actual pharmacy. They will work with the actual prescribing doctor. This is unique because there’s a lot of companies now all of a suddenly offering the access to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquin. But you know what they are, They’re just marketing companies. When you give them your name and email address and phone number, they sell that to doctors and pharmacies who then fulfill those orders, and that’s sent to you private labeled, so it looks like it’s coming from one of these famous companies health freedom companies, but it’s been marked up two or three times plus. If you have questions about a dosage, who are you going to call a marketing company? In the case of All Family Pharmacy, you can talk to the actual prescribing physician or just get in touch with the pharmacy, probably one of the brothers you talk to.

A Trump DOJ headed by Pambondi and I warned you about Pam. I had reason to worry about Pam. This comes from a Headline USA article Trump DOJ will argue for expanding surveillance power. In tower Dump’s case, Pam Bondi’s DOJ is carrying up to carry out a major power grab. Despite promising to protect civil liberties such as free speech, the Trump administration is gearing up to expand the government’s domestic surveillance powers. This past Tuesday, that was last week, prosecutor at the Justice Department filed the motion to appeal a federal judges order that’s so called tower dumps are unconstitutional. Tower dumps refer to a technique law enforcement uses to collect sell data from all devices that are connected to specific cell tower during a specific time period. This method allows enforcement agencies to gather information on hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousand cell phones in a given area, often without acquiring a warrant. The issue stems from a recent case in the U S District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi, where US Magistrate Judge Andrew Harris declined to issue such warrants for tower dumps on February twenty first, twenty twenty five. According to a recent report by judicial website court Watch, Harris ruled that this technique violence the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searchers and seizures. You think, should the government be able to go out and collect mass bits of information like this or massive amounts of information like this in order to triangulate where you might have been on a given day. Now, if they’re looking for a specific person, go get this person’s phone. If they’re looking for specific people, go get a warrant for specific people’s phones. But the power of government acquiring data like this and then magically discovering things when they decide to focus them on certain areas and ignore others is right in front of us with selective enforcement. So a judge from Brazil thinks that he can arrest the US citizen. US District Court judges think they can run American foreign policy, and the Trump administration thinks they should be allowed to spy on people. All in, that’s one of the bad things that’s going on in terms of intelligence. One of the good things. President Trump has decided to revoke the security clearance of Perkins Cooy employees over lawfare and DEI practices and my judgment, k Perkins Cooey decided to become a political law firm full disclosure. When I was a startup CEO, they were my lawyers, my litigators, and I think they actually did Yeah, I think they did issuances for us too, of stocks. But we had a litigator from there and I loved her. I thought she was an incredible lawyer. That was a prestigious firm to be with. At the time, we were lucky to get represented by them. Full disclosure. I wouldn’t have them work on a thing for me today. They made a decision to go all in on Democrat politics, and it makes sense because they’ve got a big office in Seattle. What they became, in my judgment, was a money laundering op. Hillary Clinton had some dirty political actions she needed carried out. She pretended it was for legal services. They decided to carry out these so called legal services, which was really nothing more in my judgment, than being a passer entity, which is classic money laundering. So it’s a mix of good and bad. These people should not have security clearances. The government should not have the ability to do tower dumps, to look into the background of everybody in a given geographic region who touched a single tower. A Brazilian court judge does not have the power to extradite a US citizen. And yet there’s a trend when the Constitution is ignored and conservatism means conserving our constitutional rights, constitutional rights that are bounded by what God does for us. When you depart that form of conservatism, conserving God given constitutional rights, God protected rights like speech, like life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, like the ability to defend your life, or to be secure in your homes, it’s only a matter of time before what you’re really trying to conserve is your opinion of things. That’s dangerously close to where we get ourselves when we treat governments like cult leader story number three in the month of Ramadan, I’m watching Catholics and Catholic leaders do the strangest thing. They seem to be indicating that Ramadan is a time of reflection for Christians, and in the case of the Catholic Church, that it’s time for Catholics for a school of inner transformation. That’s an odd thing to say. These are not the same faiths. One is the true faith, the way to God Almighty Jesus Christ said, no one gets to the Father but through me. Another is a religion invented by a warrior who is a literate and got nearly everything wrong. In terms of the timeline of Jesus. He was a warrior who was under control of others, and so wrote peaceful poems that write them, had them dictated, and later wrote very specific, very violent instructions for followers. One is the way of actual peace. That’s been abused Christian He’s been abused, wildly, abused, still is sometimes. And yet Islam is also a political structure. I know there’s been from time to time the creation of Christian political structures. But you cannot be a Christian and force people to be a Christian. How do I know that? Because Jesus never did that. It’s a corrupt notion. So we get into both of these stories here in a second corruption so often follows money, and right now there is so much corruption being revealed by the people it doze. It’s ungodly levels of corruption. And this has the opportunity to either set free your retirement dreams. They could float on clouds of soft, fuzzy happiness or sink them. Because if the Empire wins and this corruption is allowed to continue, I think they’ve overcome the last great hope to stop them from totally totally rating the treasury. My opinion, if we do stop it, we could see a rebirth of the American economy. Either way, you need to make sure your retirement account is set up to take advantage of this, because if we get this victory, your account might not be set up to take advantage of it. That would require, in my mind, active management of every portfolio, which is what Zach Abraham at Chief investment Officer Bulwart Capital Management does, and active management of portfolios can actually reduce risk and volatility, and that’s Zach’s obsession risk management. Inspired by Doe, she’s putting on a free live webinar consider your Department of Retirement Efficiency. The webinar is called the First hundred Days. Zach’s gonna look at the rapid changes, give what he thinks is a long term reasonable outlook for twenty twenty five, and you’ll talk about how Bowart Capital Management is always looking to lower costs while getting you a better retirement and not exposing you to unneeded risk.

Cardinal Dolan here, thanks for joining. You realize that tomorrow Ramadan starts. Ramadan is the season of penance for our Islamic brothers and sisters. Do they ever take it seriously? Okay, let’s stop for a second. Why are they our brothers and sisters? No, I’m asking, are they now in the body of Christ? They are our neighbors. They may well be our friends, they may well be our family, they may well be our enemies. In all those cases, we’re to pray for them, all of them. But honestly, in the body of Christ, we are brothers and sisters. In that body that actually means something. I know, I know, I know. I call guys bro to. I’ve got female friends who call sister’s sister. And it’s not that relationship. This is a cardinal. Maybe this is an appeal to Muslims. Maybe this is what this is. It’s triangulation. Maybe he’s hoping to draw them in by friendly love. Maybe that’s it. I choose to believe that about Cardinal Dolan. Let’s let him continue. By the way, what’s he eating for breakfast? It’s good. I don’t eat bread, but that looks really good. It’s fasting in prayer. Now. I always remember I wasn’t here in New York. Long I got into a cab and it was kind of a hot day. Because Raminon’s not always in March. It moves around, so this must have been. A heated month. And I had a bag of some water, and I was so thirsty. I took some water and I drank it, and I said to the driver, would you like some water? And he said, you bet, I’d like some water. I am very thirsty, but it’s Ramenan and I cannot take water till the sunset. That’s how seriously they take their fasting in prayer. Now, I tell you that to shame you, because because ash Wednesday’s coming up, all. Right, Wednesday, that’s the cardinal. That’s kind of our Catholic Ramadan. So let’s unite with our Islamic brothers and sisters. You know, let’s not. No, Oh my gosh, cardinal, you were there. He goes to dip the adnut in the coffee. You were there. No, let’s not unite. We can’t unite. You have one group of people who is praying to a guy who got everything wrong about the timeline of Jesus, who was a warrior who took children brides. And I know it was the time. I know it was the region. Jesus didn’t do that, and he lived at an earlier date. The Old Testament taught you don’t do that. Jesus taught to turn the other cheek. Jesus taught to love your enemy. These are not the same faiths. Jesus was not a warrior, and he could have been Oh Jesus need to do was go to the Zealots and say, hey, guys, I’m thinking about setting up a military division. I’ll go do the peace thing in front of the people and the human relations, and I’ll go do miracles that I need you to go out and take care of the military stuff you think they wouldn’t have. It’s not the same faith. This from Life Site News. The Vatican has issued a Ramadan message to Muslims, saying that it’s coinciding with Christian season of Lent is a unique opportunity to walk side by side. Ramadan appears to his Catholics as a school of inner transformation, the Vatican wrote today. By abstanding from food and drink, Muslims learn to control their desires and to turn to what is essential. Referencing the Catholic litter jerkal season of Lent, the Vatican favorally compared it with Ramadan. These spiritual practices they’ll express differently remind us of the faith. It is not merely outward expression, but a path of inner conversion. To what. Why don’t we do this with yoga? Why doesn’t he go out and issue there’s a lot of people who practice spiritual yoga. They fast too. Why not do that? These are not the same faiths. We can’t unite. They’re not walking the same path. We cannot abide together. They are completely different destinations life, say snuge rites. The passages are found in the message released today from the Vatican Dicastry of inter Religious Dialogue to Muslims for the period of Ramadan, which started in March one, with Lent beginning a few days later. An increased number of comparisons have been drawn by the Vatican and certain cardinals in an apparently ecumenical attempt to align Catholicism in Islam. How do you do that? Jesus Christ said, I’m the way, the truth of the life. No one comes to the Father but through me. The Bible is replete with warnings about false gods and false prophets that would come and then came Islam. We can go back to the beginning of the creation of the Islamic family. That came through a terrible decision made in the Bible predict it. And this is what we see. It’s Catholics jobs, it’s Christian’s jobs, to love our enemies, to give them the shirt off our back if they take our cloak, to turn the other cheek, to speak truth in grace and love. And part of that truth is no, we cannot unite. Jesus Christ when he came to Earth for his three year ministry and his thirty three year life, we think his thirty three years in that three year ministry, do you know that he challenged the most powerful religious organization in his region. He told their teachers, they’re power brokers, they’re religious tectocrats. At the time, you have it all wrong, I have it all right. The Sermon on the Mouth is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful piece of preaching and teaching. This is the same Jesus who said you have heard it said, But I tell you he was taking religious power away from the powerful. That’s who Jesus was. The original culture warrior, as it were. He didn’t say, why don’t we align with our brothers, the Pharisees, why don’t we walk in ecumenical joy? Instead, he called them sons of Satan because of what they’d done to the faith. He turned over tables in temples they had bespoiled. This is my father’s house. It’s not a farmhouse. As people were selling animals for sacrifice. Wouldn’t have made more sense for a Jewish man. Jesus was a Jewish Man from the House of David, to say, world Jews, why don’t we re knit? Status Sees Pharisees. That’s all your night. I’ll do some of the things you like. You do some of the things all like, why do you think Jesus didn’t do that? Here’s my theory. Because God is truth and light, and in him there is no darkness at all. He couldn’t do it because truth cannot lie. Jesus didn’t tell truth. He was and is truth. This is the Todd Hermann Show. Please go, be well, be strong, be kind, and please make every effort to walk in the light of the One True Christ.</em></p><h3 name="a00b" id="a00b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">That transcript is a fascinating mix of ideological fervor, conspiratorial thinking, and selective outrage — wrapped up in a media performance aimed at reinforcing a particular worldview.</h3><blockquote name="4dcd" id="4dcd" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h3">There’s a rhythm to the rhetoric, an interplay between faith, politics, and culture war narratives that serve as a vehicle for reinforcing tribal loyalty.</blockquote><p name="3485" id="3485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">At its core, this is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">performative epistemology</strong>, a term that describes the act of constructing an alternative knowledge system — one designed not for genuine inquiry, but for ideological reinforcement.

This paper examines the rhetorical, ideological, and structural mechanisms that drive Hermer’s operation, analyzing its effects on the erosion of public trust, its deployment of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">reactionary populism</strong>, and the underlying <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">grift economy</strong> that sustains it.

His programming operates under a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">constant sense of emergency</strong>, where every news cycle is framed as existentially dangerous, every political opponent is an agent of moral corruption, and every <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">viewer’s inaction is tantamount to surrender</strong>.</p><p name="4195" id="4195" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This business model is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">self-perpetuating</strong>.
