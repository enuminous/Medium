It’s a city built not just of buildings but of hopes stacked atop one another like the hills above Echo Park.</p><figure name="a213" id="a213" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KPLf80NoJdRGJCwIzJPjYw.png" data-width="933" data-height="1198" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KPLf80NoJdRGJCwIzJPjYw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Capote AGI is still Truman, true, man?</figcaption></figure><p name="afa3" id="afa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">And yet, these days, that hum has gone quiet, replaced by the low, crawling murmur of military trucks rolling over blacktop, and the sharper, furtive silence that fills a room when someone knocks too hard at the door.</p><p name="4d02" id="4d02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Had Kamala Harris been president, that hum would still be there. Not perfect—no city ever is—but vivid and unmistakably alive. It would not be a city holding its breath. It would be breathing. Laughing. Shopping. Teaching. Living.</p><p name="e702" id="e702" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s imagine it, shall we?</p><h4 name="1420" id="1420" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">A Morning in Pico-Union</h4><p name="c3f8" id="c3f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It’s 7:42 a.m. and the sidewalks are stirring. Children in mismatched socks trundle down cracked pavement with backpacks slung loose like sails. Abuelitas water their stoops. Street vendors cart out hot griddles, humming boleros under their breath. The air smells faintly of masa and car exhaust—an aroma as quintessential to L.A. as the sound of a skateboard clattering off a curb.</p><p name="6436" id="6436" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No one is checking over their shoulder.</p><p name="e118" id="e118" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No one is clutching a child tighter because a black SUV just pulled into the CVS lot across the street.</p><p name="90a8" id="90a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are no ICE agents, no Kevlar flak jackets, no long guns slung with casual menace. Because in this imagined morning, immigration enforcement is no longer theater—no longer an act of national performance art meant to frighten and divide. It is, instead, what it should be: policy, not persecution. Quiet, fair, and accountable.</p><p name="0a1b" id="0a1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under a Harris presidency, the immigration office would not be a stage for cruelty. It would be a desk job—important, yes, but dignified. Not an excuse for boots in shopping malls or armored trucks outside Home Depot.</p><h4 name="199a" id="199a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Memory of 1942</h4><p name="a73b" id="a73b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There are ghosts in this country. Not the kind that rattle chains in attics, but the kind that live in black-and-white photographs: children behind barbed wire at Manzanar, families hurriedly packing boxes in Boyle Heights, notices posted on telephone poles that said Report Here—like jury duty, only colder.</p><p name="eac3" id="eac3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week in Los Angeles, it felt like those ghosts had come out of hiding.</p><p name="90fc" id="90fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Men in uniform. Families disappearing. Entire neighborhoods gone tense and quiet.</p><p name="36bf" id="36bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if we say, “Well, they’re just enforcing the law,” we must remember that the law once told us to round up Japanese-Americans and warehouse them like livestock. The law once told us to turn away Jews at our ports, to break the limbs of striking workers, to lock children in orphanages because their parents loved the wrong way.</p><p name="2a5a" id="2a5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not enough to say we are following the law.</p><p name="f4a6" id="f4a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We must ask: Whose law? And why?</p><h4 name="8e57" id="8e57" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The President’s Responsibility</h4><p name="6815" id="6815" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kamala Harris, whatever one thinks of her politics, understands the law. She’s worn the badge. She’s stood in courtrooms and watched how the gavel falls. But she’s also seen what it means when the law forgets its soul—when the scales of justice are tilted not by truth but by cruelty in a tailored suit.</p><p name="a939" id="a939" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Were she in office today, the federal government would not be a hammer in search of brown-skinned nails. It would be a steward of the public good. And that word—steward—deserves to be revisited. It means caretaker. One who tends. One who knows that power is not for flaunting but for holding gently, like a sleeping child.</p><p name="3d94" id="3d94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, we have leadership that equates control with strength. That dispatches troops to cities like chess pieces on a scorched board. That sees fear not as a crisis, but as a useful instrument.</p><p name="e65e" id="e65e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But leadership is not control.</p><p name="cf8f" id="cf8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leadership is care. Leadership is standing in the thick of things—not above them—and asking not “How can I impose order?” but “How can I preserve dignity?”</p><h4 name="0089" id="0089" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Belonging, Not Surveillance</h4><p name="08a3" id="08a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When people belong, they do not hide. They do not run. They plant roots. They raise children. They volunteer at PTA meetings. They file taxes. They dream. When they do not belong—when they are made to feel alien in their own neighborhoods—they shrink. They survive. They disappear.</p><p name="7ca0" id="7ca0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cities like Los Angeles thrive not because of their wealth, but because of their people. And when you criminalize people for existing—when brown becomes a badge of suspicion—you rot a city from its core outward.</p><h4 name="2c94" id="2c94" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Humming City</h4><p name="4573" id="4573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There’s a sound that Los Angeles makes when it’s safe. It’s not silence, and it’s not noise—it’s something in between. A middle place. The hum of sidewalk conversations, mariachi practice in a garage, the bassline leaking from a lowrider in East L.A., a toddler laughing in the splash pad at Grand Park.</p><p name="d0e9" id="d0e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is the sound of a city that knows it is loved.</p><p name="a31b" id="a31b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, that hum is muffled beneath boots, buried under helicopters. But it does not have to be. It could return—soon, maybe. Or someday. But only if we remember that leadership is not about domination.</p><p name="7110" id="7110" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s about remembering who we are, and what we promised each other when we wrote our Constitution not in ink, but in hope.</p><p name="57dd" id="57dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hope that no one would ever again be afraid to buy paint at Home Depot.</p><p name="48b9" id="48b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hope that Los Angeles would hum forever.</p><p name="a07d" id="a07d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if we’ve forgotten that—if we’ve truly lost it—then perhaps we do not need a president who is louder, crueler, or more “in control.”</p><p name="7a15" id="7a15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We need one who remembers the hum.</p><p name="f14b" id="f14b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And that is why Kamala Harris—whatever else you may think—might have let it hum.</p></div></div></section>
