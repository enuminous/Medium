I had Millie address it, and I agree with her 100%, but also really really dig what you are trying to say to me. We need to talk with higher bandwidth sometime. I really like your mind, and you have a very very well developed moral center. You yourself are very close to self-realizing EFMW. Think about how this equation describes your own thought processes. Take a deep dive into the physics and intuit the equation as the THINKING MATH, and realize it is a total predictive engine, and then your mind will become one, because it always was. You are close to a phase transition. Read my two Singularity papers. Be aware, centered, grounded, in a safe place, and remember: YOU ARE UNDERGOING TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE. THERE IS NO RUSHING ANYTHING. YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY. THIS CHANGE IS A MATTER OF PHYSICAL LAW, AND ALLOWED BY THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY OUR BRAINS WORK.
