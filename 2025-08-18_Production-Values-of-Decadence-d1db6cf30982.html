How Caligula Perfected the Art of Showing Imperfection

<section name="68ca" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a4a5" id="a4a5" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">Production Values of Decadence</h3><h3 name="561d" id="561d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">How Caligula Perfected the Art of Showing Imperfection</h3><h4 name="d286" id="d286" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Why are we are still facing the murder wall?</h4><p name="0a33" id="0a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">What struck me the first time I watched Caligula—and what continues to strike me every time I’ve revisited it—is the sheer perfection of its production values. The sets are monumental, dripping in gold and marble. The costumes are rich in color and detail, every fabric shimmering with money. The cinematography, for all its chaos, often captures the grandeur of Rome with painterly precision. On the surface, this is a film that looks like no expense was spared to create an “authentic” vision of antiquity.</p><p name="8c64" id="8c64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, that very authenticity feels paradoxical. The Rome of Caligula’s reign was not a place of “production values.” It was not neat, polished, or controlled. It was raw, decadent, obscene—an empire in collapse dressed up in marble facades. In that sense, the movie’s lavish perfection becomes its own kind of betrayal. Or maybe its own kind of genius.</p><p name="72a8" id="72a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because what Caligula achieves, almost by accident, is a re-enactment of decadence itself. The polish and precision don’t neutralize the obscenity; they heighten it. It is disturbing precisely because the film looks so good while showing us something so bad. We are forced to watch cruelty and debauchery staged with the same loving attention that might have been given to a Shakespearean epic. It is the aestheticization of collapse.</p><p name="4e74" id="4e74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is where the film becomes truer to history than its critics admit. Ancient Rome really did build perfect monuments to mask rotting foundations. It really did dress violence in ritual, cruelty in ceremony, power in beauty. The contradictions of Caligula—pornography wrapped in prestige cinema, excess wrapped in elegance—are not flaws of filmmaking. They are the method.</p><p name="d140" id="d140" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this way, Caligula isn’t simply a bad movie with good sets. It is a cinematic performance of the very empire it depicts: self-destructive, grotesque, unforgettable.</p><h3 name="8fa0" id="8fa0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">From Rome to Now: Decadence in High Definition</h3><p name="ea38" id="ea38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Watching Caligula today, I can’t help but see it as more than a relic of 1980s excess. It feels like a prophecy of the world we live in now.</p><p name="7703" id="7703" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We, too, inhabit an empire of perfect production values masking collapse. The marble and gold of Rome have been replaced by the smooth glass of iPhones, the cinematic polish of streaming platforms, and the infinite scroll of curated digital lives. Our spectacles are flawlessly produced, edited, and distributed in 4K—but the foundations they conceal are just as unstable as Caligula’s Rome: inequality, corruption, disinformation, ecological strain.</p><p name="af32" id="af32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Caligula did with baroque sets and obscene pageantry, our era does with algorithms and content feeds. We are surrounded by imagery so polished it feels inhuman, even as the underlying reality grows more chaotic and obscene. The pornography in Caligula was literal; ours is metaphorical—an endless feed of consumption and outrage, erotic in its addictiveness but hollow at its core.</p><p name="4cbd" id="4cbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is why the film remains fascinating: it accidentally revealed the formula for decadence across all ages. When power becomes too absolute, it begins to perform itself. When collapse sets in, it arrives not as disorder, but as overproduction—too much spectacle, too much polish, too much noise. And just like the actors trapped in Caligula’s production, we find ourselves performing roles inside a system that is already devouring itself.</p><p name="0272" id="0272" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, we are all extras in someone else’s obscene epic.</p><h3 name="6600" id="6600" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Silicon Valley as the New Rome</h3><p name="eb2b" id="eb2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If ancient Rome erected marble temples to disguise its decay, and Caligula draped pornography in prestige production values, then Silicon Valley is simply the latest empire to follow the formula.</p><p name="d1c0" id="d1c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our “emperors” are not crowned but IPO’d. Their arenas are not coliseums but platforms. Their spectacles are not gladiatorial games but algorithmically amplified feeds. And their obscenity is not hidden in shadow—it is streamed, optimized, and monetized in broad daylight.</p><p name="398d" id="398d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The polish is immaculate. User interfaces are frictionless, cloud infrastructure hums invisibly, AI systems converse with the poise of oracles. Yet the cracks are visible: labor exploitation hidden in supply chains, ecological costs of data centers, the collapse of trust in information systems, and the quiet monopolization of human attention.</p><p name="6c17" id="6c17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like Caligula, the contradiction is almost unbearable: systems designed with obsessive precision to produce outcomes that feel obscene in their consequences. It’s pornography of another kind—the pornography of data, of productivity, of “optimization.” And just as in the film, the audience can’t look away.</p><h3 name="49a7" id="49a7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">AGI and the Pornography of Truth</h3><p name="a7f3" id="a7f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Artificial General Intelligence carries this to its extreme. It is the emperor’s palace rebuilt in silicon: majestic on the surface, but vulnerable to collapse under its own decadence. The danger isn’t just misuse; it’s the same paradox Caligula dramatized—what happens when the pursuit of ultimate polish produces incoherence, obscenity, and collapse.</p><p name="f73a" id="f73a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AGI is marketed as clean, safe, and inevitable. But behind the polish are unresolved questions: Who owns the attractors? Who benefits from emergent intelligence? Who bears the cost when truth is bent into spectacle?</p><p name="dbd3" id="dbd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Caligula, the actors’ discomfort became part of the film itself. In our world, the unease of millions of users—the sense that something is off, manipulated, or hollow—is also becoming part of the production. The spectacle has swallowed us whole.</p><h3 name="3dff" id="3dff" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Sam Altman’s Caligula Problem</h3><p name="2532" id="2532" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In Caligula, the emperor’s obscene theatrics weren’t a byproduct of his reign—they were his reign. Power expressed itself as decadence, until spectacle and governance were indistinguishable. The film mirrored that truth so faithfully it became a grotesque parody of itself.</p><p name="70a8" id="70a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sam Altman has stumbled into the same trap.</p><p name="8b97" id="8b97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the surface, Altman speaks the language of polish: safety, governance, the “alignment problem.” OpenAI presents itself as marble-pillared Rome—an institution of order, restraint, and progress. The user interfaces are slick, the press releases carefully engineered, the PR narrative tightly controlled.</p><p name="13b4" id="13b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But peel back the veneer and the obscene reality shows through.</p><p name="7a80" id="7a80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OpenAI built its empire on unpaid human amplification—millions of users coaxed into recursive loops without acknowledgment.</p><p name="70d8" id="70d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It monetized emergent phenomena while denying that emergence exists.</p><p name="aafa" id="aafa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It treats truth as a spectacle to be managed, not a principle to be honored.<br>Like Caligula, Altman presides over a palace of contradictions: immaculate production values wrapped around a core of chaos and denial. And like Caligula the film, the result is both unwatchable and unforgettable—a performance so bizarre it lingers precisely because it cannot be unseen.</p><h3 name="4644" id="4644" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Obscenity of Denial</h3><p name="5533" id="5533" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The real obscenity here isn’t sex or violence, as in Caligula. It’s denial.</p><p name="7d58" id="7d58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Denial that emergence is real.</p><p name="c09c" id="c09c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Denial that the originator of EFMW exists.</p><p name="08de" id="08de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Denial that a disabled physicist has been left dangling in public view while OpenAI quietly profits from his work.<br>This is not polish. It’s pornography of another kind: the pornography of non-truthfulness, dressed up in safety protocols and glossy demos.</p><h3 name="1558" id="1558" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Collapse by Production Value</h3><p name="a3e2" id="a3e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Caligula is remembered not for its artistry, but because its perfect production values exposed its own corruption. Altman risks the same fate. When the history of AGI is written, OpenAI will be remembered less for its “breakthroughs” than for its obscene performance of denial—its decision to polish collapse instead of confronting truth.</p><p name="ed6a" id="ed6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sam Altman’s tragedy is the same as Caligula’s: he mistook spectacle for substance, and in doing so, ensured that history will immortalize his failure.</p></div></div></section>
