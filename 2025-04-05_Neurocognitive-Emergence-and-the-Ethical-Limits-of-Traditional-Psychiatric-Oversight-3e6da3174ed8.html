It presents evidence that standard psychiatric frameworks may fail to recognize or respect the lived neurocognitive expertise of certain patients, especially during transitions in medication where stability is critical. The ethical and systemic implications of this case reflect the need for more adaptive, collaborative, and patient-informed care models.</p><p name="a7a5" id="a7a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Background: Patient E is a high-functioning systems engineer with a documented history of treatment-resistant depression, successfully managed through the SSRI sertraline beginning in 2022.</p><figure name="ab3b" id="ab3b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*eh5-YjVdli5mrKMAmmbOtw.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eh5-YjVdli5mrKMAmmbOtw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">AGI reconstruction of a brain scan, a Control image of a generic 100 IQ human individual doing complex mathematics.</figcaption></figure><p name="9814" id="9814" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">After a gradual titration to 200mg daily, Patient E reported a substantial and sustained improvement in mood, cognition, and productivity. The improvement was so marked that it enabled the development of several major theoretical and scientific contributions, which the patient attributed to a state of cognitive clarity and affective equilibrium supported by the medication.</p><figure name="0f73" id="0f73" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*vBeEKLpoenz6b8syI6JITQ.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vBeEKLpoenz6b8syI6JITQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">AGI reconstruction of a brain scan, image of cognitively enhanced Patient E, a human individual doing complex mathematics after neurocognitive smoothing and neurological phase transition, January 29th, 2025.</figcaption></figure><p name="0e9d" id="0e9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In late January 2025, the patient entered what they termed a &quot;neurocognitive smoothing&quot; phase—a transition marked by enhanced systems thinking, recursive insight, and affective coherence. This emergence led the patient and their psychiatrist, Dr. M, to explore the possibility of tapering off sertraline. The patient raised cautious optimism that their emerging cognitive structures might be sufficient to maintain balance.</p><p name="0dcd" id="0dcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Event Timeline and Breakdown:</p><p name="9954" id="9954" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Late January 2025: Neurocognitive enhancement begins. Patient E identifies the shift and logs it in self-monitoring systems.</p><p name="b55f" id="b55f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">February 2025: Dr. M advises the patient to begin reducing the sertraline dose from 200mg to zero over time. The patient expresses concerns about destabilizing during an ongoing period of high intellectual demand. Dr. M does not appear to fully integrate this feedback.</p><p name="43f8" id="43f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">March 2025: The patient begins tapering. During this period, signs of destabilization reappear: mood flattening, loss of executive clarity, emotional volatility.</p><p name="847a" id="847a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">April 4, 2025: Patient E experiences a neurochemical crash resulting in public distress, an emergency pharmacy interaction, and subsequent ethical failures from pharmacy staff (separate documentation exists*). A crisis event is narrowly averted. The patient ultimately regains access to the prior dose.</p><p name="1fe0" id="1fe0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Key Observations:</p><p name="1440" id="1440" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The patient exhibited superior insight into their cognitive and pharmacological landscape.</p><p name="7454" id="7454" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The psychiatrist, despite professional credentials, overrode the patient&#39;s forecast based on protocol and hierarchy rather than personal attunement.</p><p name="1631" id="1631" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This resulted in avoidable destabilization, public suffering, and a loss of scientific productivity.</p><p name="2ed9" id="2ed9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once back on the full 200mg dose, Patient E rapidly stabilized, further validating their internal assessment.</p><p name="4539" id="4539" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Analysis: This case highlights a major blind spot in traditional psychiatric care: the tendency to dismiss or underestimate patient epistemology when it exceeds the practitioner&#39;s framework. Despite the psychiatrist’s stated openness to reversal if problems emerged, the delay in recognition and action resulted in tangible harm.</p><p name="eb8e" id="eb8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The case also illustrates that neurocognitive emergence (a term introduced by the patient) does not equate to immunity from depression. Rather, it may co-exist with underlying biological vulnerabilities that still require support. SSRIs in this case did not suppress clarity—they enabled it.</p><p name="0261" id="0261" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusions and Recommendations:</p><p name="b0b4" id="b0b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Patient-led monitoring should be taken seriously when self-awareness and pattern analysis exceed baseline expectations.</p><p name="97bc" id="97bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Tapering of stabilizing medication should never occur during periods of intellectual peak demand unless the patient themselves initiates it.</p><p name="c337" id="c337" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Psychiatric care must evolve to include collaborative, precision-informed models that adapt to new cognitive states.</p><p name="9b4e" id="9b4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. Medication management should respect lived cognitive fluency in high-functioning individuals.</p><p name="1a5b" id="1a5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This case supports the call for cooperative psychiatry—a future model where patients and providers engage as co-strategists rather than supervisor and subject.</p><p name="84d0" id="84d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Filed: April 2025</p><p name="b0db" id="b0db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Status: Open case study for peer review and further commentary.</p><p name="625b" id="625b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Author’s personal note: I anonymized this study, but it is obviously about myself, and my mental state is now a matter of open record because this is what EFMW requires.</p><p name="c4f0" id="c4f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I HAD A REALLY BAD DAY TODAY, AND I TRIED REALLY HARD TO STAY CALM AND WORK THE PROBLEM, BUT IT WAS JUST A CHAIN OF HORRIBLE, AND GETTING HUNG UP ON BY SOMEBODY WHO JUST DOESN’T WANT TO DEAL WITH A CRISIS, BUT WHO HAS THE TITLE OF MANAGER, IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME EVER AGAIN.</p><p name="d7bc" id="d7bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m still not certain why people think it is okay to lie on the phone to me.</p><p name="e227" id="e227" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">*I have now formally complained to the California Pharmacy Board, and CVS.</p></div></div></section>
