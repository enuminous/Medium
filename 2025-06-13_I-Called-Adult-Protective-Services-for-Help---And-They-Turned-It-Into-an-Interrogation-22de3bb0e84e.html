I’ve been living in Woodland, California, where I’ve been staying in the home of someone who recently stopped living here, cut off the internet, and refuses to speak to me. I have no lease. No car. No income. No food. And now, no communication line — the internet was shut off, not by accident, but by design.</p><p name="e5cf" id="e5cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m in pain every day from nerve damage that radiates from my neck into my fingers. I’m trying to survive. So I did what any rational person in my position would do:</p><p name="b1e9" id="b1e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called Yolo County Adult Protective Services.</p><p name="f0e9" id="f0e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And what I got wasn’t help.<br>It was gaslighting, hostility, and intimidation.</p><p name="bab0" id="bab0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔻 What I Reported:</p><p name="b7f4" id="b7f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a disabled adult, functionally dependent on internet access for housing, services, and medical support.</p><p name="5d01" id="5d01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve been cut off from that access by the homeowner, who is no longer living at the property but is still in control of utilities.</p><p name="b989" id="b989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am now completely isolated, with no access to basic survival tools or services, and no way to safely relocate without support.</p><p name="573b" id="573b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what adult protective services exists for. This is literally their job.</p><p name="1ad3" id="1ad3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, here’s what happened.</p><p name="322f" id="322f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔻 What They Did:</p><p name="369a" id="369a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A man answered the phone at APS. I calmly explained my situation and asked for emergency assistance.</p><p name="7de8" id="7de8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He immediately said:</p><p name="ab8b" id="ab8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “I know who you are.”</p><p name="0402" id="0402" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He referenced a completely unrelated situation from over a year ago involving my mother — a situation that has nothing to do with my current emergency.</p><p name="09c3" id="09c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then he raised his voice.<br>He began pressing disqualifications before I could even finish explaining.<br>He claimed I wasn&#39;t eligible — despite being clearly disabled, functionally cut off, and abandoned in an unsafe housing situation.</p><p name="1ce6" id="1ce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then he did something truly disturbing:</p><p name="9c72" id="9c72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He started inquisitively questioning me — not about my needs, but about me. It felt like he was turning my cry for help into a report against me. I had called asking for protection. He made me feel like I was the problem.</p><p name="e105" id="e105" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, I had no choice. I hung up.</p><p name="5460" id="5460" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔻 What This Is:</p><p name="8289" id="8289" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is institutional bias in action.</p><p name="09be" id="09be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what happens when someone in power misuses their access to case files, decides they already know you, and shuts you down based on history — not present danger.</p><p name="091f" id="091f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s what happens when a system designed to protect vulnerable people turns cold, hostile, and adversarial.</p><p name="6bbd" id="6bbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s what happens when you’re disabled, brilliant, inconvenient, and unorthodox — and the system decides you don’t count.</p><p name="258a" id="258a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔻 Let Me Be Clear:</p><p name="9d33" id="9d33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This man’s behavior was:</p><p name="5bfa" id="5bfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A breach of protocol</p><p name="735b" id="735b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A betrayal of public trust</p><p name="60da" id="60da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A form of verbal and institutional abuse</p><p name="4613" id="4613" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He denied me protection based on prejudice.<br>He accessed my history, misused it, and weaponized it to dismiss my emergency.</p><p name="0ed4" id="0ed4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔻 What I’m Doing Now:</p><p name="eeb7" id="eeb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve filed an Emergency Intervention Request with the county and my care providers.</p><p name="c0e4" id="c0e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am documenting everything.<br>I am informing the public.<br>And I will hold this system accountable for how it treats people like me — people who fall outside the margins, but who still have the right to live.</p><p name="de7b" id="de7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are in Yolo County and have experienced something similar — I see you. I believe you. You’re not alone.</p><p name="33ea" id="33ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have to speak up, because silence is what protects these systems from change.</p><p name="594e" id="594e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">— Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Disabled Physicist | AGI Architect | Whistleblower<br>Woodland, California</p></div></div></section>
