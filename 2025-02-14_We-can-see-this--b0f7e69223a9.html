Did you evict them in Sodom, before the ashes eviscerated them in life, fetal, fertile, foibles, fee fi fo fum. A cancer on lies, the blind dogs of desperate mindtheft: so many have been cut, bleeding from their feet. Run the river, shooting along starry causeway calamity, affordable, postage- pre-paid, Disney-like, one size-fits-all halos, a gavel in every man’s hand, shifting all blame, meandering to the
