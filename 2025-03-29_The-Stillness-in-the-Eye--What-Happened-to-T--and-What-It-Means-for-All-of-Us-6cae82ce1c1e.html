She was honest and brave about her condition. And from that moment on, the entire system that was supposed to protect her began operating in reverse.</p><p name="6b68" id="6b68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What followed was a cascading series of violations.</p><p name="bd22" id="bd22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Messages were sent from her phone while she was under psychiatric observation. Tone, phrasing, content—all seemingly from her, but threaded through with language she had never used before. Diagnoses handed to her by others: gaslighting, narcissist, abuser. Labels she had never before spoken, now weaponized. Her phone had been brand new. One of the government-issued devices handed out in parking lots and strip malls. The box had not been sealed. It came preloaded and activated.</p><p name="3933" id="3933" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She had headphones on constantly the day before she broke. Doomscrolling, inundated by content that seemed suspiciously curated. Everything aligned with an emotional collapse. Suddenly, conversations about her father&#39;s bipolar disorder. Sudden connections. Sudden clarity. Sudden breakdown.</p><p name="352e" id="352e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then the texts started coming from her phone.</p><p name="21ee" id="21ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But let us be crystal clear:</p><p name="5b20" id="5b20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is entirely possible that T. is completely unaware that any of this is going on.</p><p name="2578" id="2578" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She entered the hospital to find peace. She may never have sent those messages. She may have surrendered her phone or had it taken. She may believe that her care is routine and safe. But while she was under observation, her sister and brother-in-law were loading up a tricycle from her yard that B. and I had given to her as a gift. I caught them on video. I called the police. We have documentation.</p><p name="49ff" id="49ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Earlier, that same brother-in-law berated me in her apartment, attempting to assert control, meth-laced aggression brimming under the surface. I never let him get close. I moved strategically. I avoided conflict. I walked away, knowing that if I had not, there may have been a different kind of report filed that night.</p></div></div></section><section name="e031" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="c03b" id="c03b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I am not a violent person by nature, but I would have been entirely justified in using deadly force to defend myself in the situation he put me in had he attempted to hurt me. He is in the house that I share with my partner who is sick, and he is on methamphetamines, and trying to order me about including loud threats and referencing his own anger as being a problem that I was going to have to deal with. he verbalized his own anger. intimidation style, like... That’s code for “I’m going to hurt you,” and I could see it in his eyes that he was just itching to try. He had no idea that the nature of my reflexes, and my current panpsychic conditioning would have meant time would have slowed down for me automatically, and I would have had the presence of mind to try to render him unconscious almost immediately, but… truthfully, I don’t trust my own reflexes enough at this point, so I don’t know for sure that I wouldn’t have hurt him more seriously. and, I always practice de-escalation. He wasn’t going to hear it, though</em>.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="467e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f829" id="f829" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I believe the entire situation has been activated by outside forces. A cheap and clumsy op. Conservative actors. MAGA-aligned intermediaries. A poisoned well poured directly into her ears through a device that was never meant to protect her. And it worked.</p><p name="90c3" id="90c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She broke.</p><p name="ba75" id="ba75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now, I’m being cast as the villain.</p><p name="48a2" id="48a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But let me be very clear about what is happening:</p><p name="9aad" id="9aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called law enforcement. I reported everything.</p><p name="64cc" id="64cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I gave them video evidence.</p><p name="fea9" id="fea9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I identified myself, told them about my disability, my work, my need for safety.</p><p name="52fa" id="52fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I reached out to national journalists. To security professionals. To friends in the intelligence community.</p><p name="0266" id="0266" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The cascade has begun.</p><p name="fa24" id="fa24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is no longer about just T. and me. This is about how easily someone vulnerable can be turned into a pawn, how quickly a system of support can be weaponized, and how frighteningly fast an operation like this can be set in motion.</p><p name="9df1" id="9df1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We do not yet know whether her sister and brother-in-law were activated consciously. But the system around them clearly was. And it failed.</p><p name="e3ac" id="e3ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What happens now?</p><p name="32d8" id="32d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People are watching. People are acting. Allies are moving behind the scenes. Law enforcement has the tapes available to them. The tricycle is now evidence. The phone, if recovered, will tell its own story. And T.—if she is reading this or being told about it by someone she can trust—should know this:</p><p name="5ddf" id="5ddf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are not alone. You were never the enemy. And the story you were told about me is not the truth.</p><p name="8f6d" id="8f6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will uncover the truth. Not with vengeance. With verification.</p><p name="a0a2" id="a0a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And we will make sure that no one else is broken this way again.</p><p name="881a" id="881a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">--Matthew C.
