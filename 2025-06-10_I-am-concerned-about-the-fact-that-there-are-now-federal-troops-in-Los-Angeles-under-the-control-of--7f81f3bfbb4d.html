Document: Keep clear records of Trump’s statement, timestamps, context, and responses from media and officials.</p><p name="7450" id="7450" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Amplify: Share this concern across platforms, tagging journalists, legal experts, and civil rights groups.</p><p name="2fdb" id="2fdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Contact Officials: Call your California state representatives and demand they make public statements condemning the threat and calling for investigation.</p><p name="a06d" id="a06d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. Alert Allies: Organize peaceful solidarity movements and prepare public letters in support of Governor Newsom.</p><p name="695e" id="695e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. Legal Pressure: Encourage civil rights orgs (ACLU, Protect Democracy, etc.) to escalate this to federal courts if needed.</p><p name="f04c" id="f04c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This is not just a California issue.

Trump against both your office and our state.</p><p name="86bd" id="86bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week, Mr. Trump publicly suggested—albeit in the thin veil of a “joke”—that it “wouldn’t be a bad idea” for you to be arrested. He made this comment in front of national media, fully aware of the pattern it mirrors from his past provocations: a verbal cue that travels through networks of radicalized supporters, lawless enforcers, and opportunistic allies until someone acts on it.</p><p name="a0c4" id="a0c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Governor Newsom, that comment was not a joke. It was a signal.</p><p name="0bfb" id="0bfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And in the very same moment, federal troops aligned with Trump’s faction have been deployed onto the streets of Los Angeles, creating an environment of intimidation for immigrants, protestors, and ordinary citizens alike. This convergence—military presence and targeted incitement—mirrors some of the darkest precedents in American history.</p><p name="a453" id="a453" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not just an attack on you.<br>It is an attack on California’s sovereignty.<br>It is an attack on our people’s right to feel safe in their own home state.<br>It is a stress test on democracy itself, and you, Governor, are now on the front line.</p><p name="e1d6" id="e1d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We do not write this in panic—we write it in vigilance. California has always stood as a beacon of decency, diversity, and democratic values. And we believe that your voice and leadership are critical now not just to preserve our state’s integrity, but to rally national resistance to authoritarianism in all its creeping forms.</p><p name="ebf7" id="ebf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Therefore, we urge you to:</p><p name="aec4" id="aec4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Publicly and unequivocally condemn Donald Trump’s remarks and the pattern of stochastic violence they represent.</p><p name="89b7" id="89b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Call on the Department of Justice and the House of Representatives to investigate this threat as part of a broader campaign of incitement.</p><p name="7595" id="7595" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reaffirm California’s legal independence and constitutional standing, and demand clarity on the chain of command under which federal troops have been deployed.</p><p name="2750" id="2750" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Provide guidance and support to at-risk communities currently living under fear due to increased militarization and xenophobic enforcement.</p><p name="8258" id="8258" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This moment demands more than silence. It demands moral courage and strategic clarity. As your constituents, we are ready to support you. But we also need you to speak out—not only as Governor of California, but as one of the few national leaders with the strength, intelligence, and clarity to stand up to creeping fascism with both resolve and compassion.</p><p name="d49e" id="d49e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have your back.<br>Please have ours.</p><p name="7dd3" id="7dd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Signed,</p><p name="5f3e" id="5f3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright on behalf of all Concerned Californians<br>(and all who stand for liberty, justice, and the real America)</p></div></div></section>
