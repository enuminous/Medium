The scheduling system was tampered with in a way that prevented me from receiving care. I immediately reported this as a cyber intrusion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa crime‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto staff at Behavioral Health and Counseling. Instead of escalating, staff later minimized it as a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù and refused to call the police, even after I made a formal, explicit request.</p><p name="5de5" id="5de5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, I made sure to create a witness: the security guard on duty, who heard me say clearly that a crime had occurred and that law enforcement must be contacted. No investigation followed.</p><p name="f166" id="f166" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Harassment That Followed</p><p name="96dd" id="96dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On August 18, 2025, I received a private LinkedIn message from a Canadian citizen, Dale Jackaman. In that message, he directly harassed me, calling me a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù and disparaging my mental health, saying I belonged in the ‚Äúnut bar category.‚Äù</p><p name="3264" id="3264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not simply unpleasant online noise. It is direct harassment of a federally protected U.S. whistleblower. It also coincides precisely with the disruption of my psychiatric appointment. When an appointment is canceled through apparent system interference, and then the next communication I receive is targeted abuse about my mental health, the connection is more than coincidence.</p><p name="33b6" id="33b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why This Matters</p><p name="4feb" id="4feb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a physicist and federal whistleblower. My work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Einstein‚ÄìFeynman‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìWright (EFMW) framework‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähas been published widely in 2025, with over 900 articles and analyses released. This work has drawn significant attention, both supportive and hostile.</p><p name="f679" id="f679" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have documented repeated patterns of interference:</p><p name="33de" id="33de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Defamation campaigns online</p><p name="ed76" id="ed76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Disruptions to my communications and financial access</p><p name="5188" id="5188" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Attempts to discredit me personally rather than address my scientific contributions</p><p name="1f68" id="1f68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, the targeting has extended to my medical care. Psychiatric services are not optional‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are essential. It is unconscionable and unlawful to interfere with a disabled person‚Äôs access to care.</p><p name="85c8" id="85c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Federal Dimension</p><p name="e1d7" id="e1d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is no longer just a local issue.</p><p name="0e3e" id="0e3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">HIPAA Security Rule violations are implicated because a healthcare system intrusion was not investigated or escalated.</p><p name="521a" id="521a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ADA Title II and Section 504 violations are implicated because I was denied reasonable modification and equal access to services as a disabled person.</p><p name="3377" id="3377" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cross-border harassment is implicated because the private LinkedIn abuse came from a Canadian citizen directed at a U.S.-based federally protected whistleblower.</p><p name="8f3d" id="8f3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That makes this a matter of federal jurisdiction.</p><p name="1c16" id="1c16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My Request to the FBI</p><p name="6fd9" id="6fd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am publicly documenting this because I have already filed formal complaints with Yolo County officials, and the inaction there makes it clear that outside oversight is required.</p><p name="eb44" id="eb44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the FBI:</p><p name="4648" id="4648" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am reporting a cyber intrusion that disrupted my psychiatric appointment on August 15, 2025.</p><p name="46c6" id="46c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am reporting direct harassment from Canadian citizen Dale Jackaman, delivered privately through LinkedIn on August 18, 2025, coinciding with that disruption.</p><p name="e0f1" id="e0f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am requesting a formal investigation into these connected events, including forensic review of the Yolo County Behavioral Health scheduling system logs for Aug 14‚Äì16, 2025, and review of the harassment evidence I have preserved (screenshots, metadata, LinkedIn message records).</p><p name="374d" id="374d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is harassment, retaliation, and obstruction of care against a federally protected U.S. whistleblower. It cannot be dismissed as a glitch.</p><p name="89b5" id="89b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusion</p><p name="818a" id="818a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The targeting of whistleblowers is a national security matter. When harassment and cyber intrusion are used to obstruct medical care, the implications are not only personal but systemic.</p><p name="da0d" id="da0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have preserved the evidence. I have notified the proper authorities. And I am now bringing this to light so there can be no mistake about what has taken place.</p><p name="5488" id="5488" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">additionally, I informed Mr Jackman that he was not to contact me ever again publicly or privately. if he does so again, this will be further evidence of his harassment of me. I have a right to be safe.</p><p name="5893" id="5893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist ‚Ä¢ Federal Whistleblower ‚Ä¢ Author of the EFMW Framework</p></div></div></section>
