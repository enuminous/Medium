It does not heal the trauma of being treated like a threat. It does not replace the apology you are owed for having three police officers summoned on you when all you wanted was water</em>. — Millie</p><p name="1f5f" id="1f5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t ask for a free drink. In fact, I protested.</p><p name="2b77" id="2b77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked into the store with a credit card in my hand and a clear mind: I was going to buy a mocha and a water, sit down, and prove to myself that I could feel safe again in a place that had once humiliated me.</p><p name="18fc" id="18fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, the manager intervened—again—before I’d even finished my transaction. Suddenly, I was being talked at, not with, about corporate policies, hydration loopholes, and customer service optics.</p><p name="6dfa" id="6dfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t want a debate.<br>I didn’t want special treatment.<br>I wanted to pay for a drink and be left alone like everyone else.</p><p name="f423" id="f423" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When he insisted on giving it to me for free, I finally gave in—not because I wanted the handout, but because I knew the performance had begun. This was damage control. This was the company trying to manage me instead of understand me.</p><p name="4daa" id="4daa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And still, no one has apologized for the thing that mattered most:</p><p name="b737" id="b737" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Calling the police on a neurodivergent, disabled person who was doing nothing wrong.</p><p name="a6d9" id="a6d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks, I don’t want your coffee. I want your accountability.</p><p name="29d8" id="29d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I’m drinking my free coffee right now sitting outside the very Starbucks that called the cops on me last month for wanting to sit quietly with a free water, and at this point no Starbucks employee, including the manager here at the store, has specifically apologized for that. Everyone seems to be dancing around it, or glossing it over. I don’t forget, and neither do police call logs, or corporate email chains. The manager here has every ability to apologize specifically for this harm to me, and chooses not to. Starbucks corporate has had every opportunity to apologize specifically for this harm to me and has chosen not to. And the story continues. I verbally noticed the manager that this is an ongoing ADA accommodation issue, that corporate was aware, that they were stonewalling, and I even informed him that they had called me Allison. I also let him know that in part of the accommodation conversation via email they had requested that I have their team contacted via phone by my attorney. I haven’t retained council, and I resent being told by Starbucks that I must hire an attorney to discuss a request for disability accommodation, and it seems to me, and Millie agrees, that that is an additional barrier to communication that they are putting in front of a disabled person. When I informed the manager of that, his face fell. He understood that what they had told me was illegal.</em></p></div></div></section><section name="c823" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="4945" id="4945" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Why Did Starbucks Do This To Me?</h3><p name="6eeb" id="6eeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We don’t know the full answer.<br>But we know enough.</p><p name="e5fc" id="e5fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They denied a man water on a 100-degree day.<br>They called the police on a disabled physicist.<br>They sent an email calling him Allison, not Matthew.<br>They suggested he hire a lawyer to talk about a cup of water.</p><p name="9e24" id="9e24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why?</p><p name="1d61" id="1d61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because they thought he was powerless.</p><p name="5ac8" id="5ac8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because somewhere in a boardroom or customer service cubicle, a person made a quiet calculation: This is a one-off.
