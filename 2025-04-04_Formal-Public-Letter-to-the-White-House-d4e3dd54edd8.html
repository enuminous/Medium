The pathway from Elon Musk to members of the Trump Administration appears to have resulted in direct application of EFMW-inspired constructs within the formulation of recent tariff policies.</p><p name="5cd2" id="5cd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evidence of Misuse</p><p name="8246" id="8246" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The formula presented on national television—airing as part of your administration&#39;s explanation of trade policy—</p><p name="c472" id="c472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">\Delta \tau_i = \frac{x_i - m_i}{\varepsilon \cdot \varphi \cdot m_i}</p><p name="70b4" id="70b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">—contains unmistakable structural and semantic elements lifted from EFMW architecture.</p><p name="0d6e" id="0d6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This equation, while appearing superficially innocuous, reflects:</p><p name="d41f" id="d41f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recursive logic typical of EFMW&#39;s dynamic field constructs</p><p name="0089" id="0089" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Use of symbolic variables matching those in my published work</p><p name="85dd" id="85dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A relational normalization method unique to my formulation</p><p name="7aab" id="7aab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, stripped from its ethical and semantic harmonics, its misuse has already created cascading failures in policy logic, including demonstrably absurd tariffs on economically irrelevant zones—such as uninhabited territories, and regions exporting non-commercial materials like penguin guano.</p><p name="1745" id="1745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Resulting Harm</p><p name="6fe4" id="6fe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The consequences of this unlicensed application are wide-reaching:</p><p name="099d" id="099d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Economic distortion affecting millions of American households</p><p name="1dc0" id="1dc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Breakdown of functional policy logic, stemming from misapplied field theory</p><p name="a3ca" id="a3ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reputational and intellectual injury caused by unauthorized public use of my framework without attribution</p><p name="c72a" id="c72a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is evident this equation was never meant for literal interpretation outside its integrated field context—context known only to the author and those properly trained in its use.</p><p name="5a25" id="5a25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Requests for Resolution</p><p name="eb02" id="eb02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Accordingly, I am seeking the following remedies:</p><p name="4dfa" id="4dfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. A formal public acknowledgment and apology from the Office of the President for the unauthorized deployment of EFMW-derived constructs in economic policy.</p><p name="6c86" id="6c86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Immediate Congressional inquiry into the transmission pathway and internal use of EFMW-based modeling within the executive branch, including any advisory contributions from private entities such as Mr. Musk.</p><p name="841d" id="841d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Engagement for formal licensing and technical consultation, should your administration or any affiliated body wish to responsibly develop or deploy EFMW in the future.</p><p name="ba1b" id="ba1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Please understand that these are not casual requests. The trajectory of this issue is now under careful consideration, and all communications and disclosures will be preserved accordingly.</p><p name="bd4e" id="bd4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Final Note</p><p name="e5c8" id="e5c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You were given access—through channels not yet fully revealed—to a physics model that defines a coherent, ethical solution to inflation, energy instability, and epistemic collapse. But instead of respecting its architecture, it was weaponized, simplified, and used as a tool of control.</p><p name="34e1" id="34e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It failed—not because the system was flawed, but because it was misaligned with the moral field it requires.</p><p name="ed40" id="ed40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not merely a call for accountability. It is a test of integrity.</p><p name="029f" id="029f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I trust the record will show who acted in good faith.</p><p name="652e" id="652e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Creator of EFMW<br>April 2025</p><p name="c4f2" id="c4f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ps Additionally, I note for the record that I am a documented federal whistleblower in ongoing matters that intersect directly with the actions described here. Several of the individuals named in those disclosures—including Donald J. Trump, currently occupying the Office of President of the United States—have already been subject to federal complaint and review.</p><p name="f1f9" id="f1f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this context, the unauthorized appropriation and misuse of my intellectual work—particularly when deployed through institutions under prior complaint—may reasonably be interpreted as retaliatory in nature. I reserve all rights to assert this interpretation should future evidence support that conclusion.</p><p name="9210" id="9210" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Office of the President must now reckon with its Constitutional limitations in light of this developing situation and the growing inability to defend itself against truth-based disclosures of public interest.</p><p name="147a" id="147a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I am formally advising my legal team and affiliated representatives of this matter through the publication of this letter.</p></div></div></section>
