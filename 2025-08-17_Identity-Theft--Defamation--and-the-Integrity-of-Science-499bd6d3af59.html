The comments were not directed at my work itself, but at me personally — questioning my sanity and ridiculing the fact that I publish outside of traditional peer-reviewed journals.</p><p name="5b22" id="5b22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ordinarily, I would ignore such noise. But the name attached to this account is not ordinary. Dale Jackaman is a well-known Canadian figure: an anti-tobacco advocate, a political candidate, a defender of secular governance, a professional investigator, and the president of a respected cybersecurity firm. His record shows decades of advocacy for science, transparency, and public accountability.</p><p name="6554" id="6554" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which is why I do not believe the person who left those comments is the real Dale Jackaman.</p><p name="f860" id="f860" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Likelihood of Impersonation</p><p name="deda" id="deda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is far too common in today’s digital ecosystem for disinformation campaigns to operate through identity theft and impersonation. The playbook is simple:</p><p name="73e3" id="73e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Clone or mimic the name of a reputable figure.</p><p name="7157" id="7157" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Use that identity to launch defamatory attacks on whistleblowers, dissidents, or scientists.</p><p name="b0c2" id="b0c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Force the target into conflict with the “real” person, creating confusion, division, and reputational harm for both.</p><p name="0e73" id="0e73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tone of the comments I received was amateurish, taunting, and unprofessional. It read more like a troll than a seasoned investigator. For that reason, I believe this Medium account is a fake, created specifically to bait me and to potentially cause friction with the real Dale Jackaman.</p><p name="0b1a" id="0b1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If It Is the Real Dale Jackaman</p><p name="f402" id="f402" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If, however, it turns out that this was indeed the real Dale Jackaman, then we are dealing with something far more troubling.</p><p name="3a4f" id="3a4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because if a man with his record and his reputation has decided to defame rather than debate, to ridicule rather than verify, then he has just placed his foot directly into a hornet’s nest. I am not merely another online voice — I am a physicist, a federal whistleblower, and the author of frameworks and discoveries that have already reshaped the global discourse on science, intelligence, and artificial general intelligence.</p><p name="4fa0" id="4fa0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Defaming me is not only an attack on my credibility — it is an attack on the integrity of the scientific process itself. And history will not look kindly on those who chose ridicule over reason.</p><p name="cf08" id="cf08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Respect and Accountability</p><p name="a8b7" id="a8b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So let me be clear:</p><p name="4380" id="4380" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the real Dale Jackaman is reading this, I respect your decades of advocacy and your contributions to public life. If your name was hijacked and used to attack me, then you too are a victim, and I urge you to look into it immediately.</p><p name="bde3" id="bde3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it wasn’t you, then an impersonator is guilty of both identity theft and defamation, and I have now placed this matter on the public record.</p><p name="be9b" id="be9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it was you, then you are accountable for those words — and you have no idea of the consequences you have just invited.</p><p name="63f1" id="63f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Closing</p><p name="0fc4" id="0fc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The work I am doing does not depend on the approval of gatekeepers or the comfort of institutions. My equations, my publications, my discoveries — they stand on their own.</p><p name="6c7a" id="6c7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What does matter is the truth. And whether we are dealing with impersonation or misplaced hostility, the truth will come out.</p><p name="66a3" id="66a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have blocked the account, rebutted the claims, and placed this issue into the public record. From here, the burden of verification lies not with me, but with those using this name.</p><p name="c799" id="c799" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because either way — whether through impersonation or through deliberate malice — this event tells us a great deal about how far some will go to silence inconvenient science.</p><p name="9e41" id="9e41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it tells us even more about why I must keep speaking.</p><p name="73f3" id="73f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">✍️ Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist • Whistleblower • Author of the EFMW Framework</p></div></div></section>
