Alone. At 5:30 in the morning.</p><p name="600b" id="600b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not making a scene. Not demanding attention.<br>Just trying to exist—just trying to get through another moment of grief in a world that too often feels like it was not built for people like me.</p><p name="f452" id="f452" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was in a Starbucks. A place that once meant warmth, familiarity, a soft chair, a glass of water, a flicker of humanity.</p><p name="a4a0" id="a4a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And instead of being seen with compassion, I was seen as a threat.<br>Instead of being given space, I was given scrutiny.<br>And instead of being offered peace, I was offered fear—three armed police officers worth of it.</p><p name="f79f" id="f79f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">⚖️ Where Was the Kindness?</p><p name="495a" id="495a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The employee didn’t ask if I was okay.<br>Didn’t offer a tissue. Didn’t pause and take a breath.<br>Didn’t wonder what it might feel like to wake up, brokenhearted, neurodivergent, traumatized, and walk into the world just trying to be left alone for a moment of calm.</p><p name="8b0a" id="8b0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She saw a crying man.<br>And instead of seeing a human in pain, she saw a policy risk.</p><p name="1836" id="1836" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of kindness, she followed a script.<br>Instead of care, she escalated.<br>And I was left standing there with shaking hands and hollow breath, being treated like a threat to be managed—because I had the audacity to be visibly hurting.</p><p name="152e" id="152e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔁 A System That Repeats Itself</p><p name="dcec" id="dcec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tried to explain, later. To Starbucks. To the company that had always marketed itself as a &quot;third place&quot;—a refuge between home and work.</p><p name="18cd" id="18cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I told them I was autistic.<br>That phone calls retraumatize me.<br>That being treated as unstable in public made me feel unsafe in my own skin.<br>That what I needed was simple: written communication, accountability, and empathy.</p><p name="1367" id="1367" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead?</p><p name="0657" id="0657" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I received five emails from five different representatives.<br>Each one ignored my request.<br>Each one tried to funnel me into a phone conversation I couldn’t tolerate.<br>Each one made me feel smaller, more erased, more afraid.</p><p name="bb34" id="bb34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then came the silence.</p><p name="36cc" id="36cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🧱 What Happens When You Build Walls Around Tears</p><p name="fdc8" id="fdc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You learn not to cry in public.<br>You learn not to ask for help.<br>You learn that pain must be hidden or punished.<br>You learn that kindness is conditional—and corporate.</p><p name="9a75" id="9a75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the truth is, this isn’t just about me.<br>It’s about all of us.</p><p name="02b9" id="02b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because somewhere along the way, we forgot how to be gentle with pain.</p><p name="7bc9" id="7bc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We built systems that treat emotion as disruption.<br>We trained employees to follow rules instead of instincts.<br>We turned public spaces into places where vulnerability is policed—not protected.</p><p name="638a" id="638a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🌊 What I Needed Was Simple</p><p name="e940" id="e940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I needed someone to see me, not manage me.<br>I needed silence, not suspicion.<br>A chair, not a confrontation.<br>A glass of water, not a patrol car.</p><p name="9b8b" id="9b8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now that I’ve spoken up? I’m being met with corporate silence.<br>A system of delay, legal containment, and risk management.</p><p name="a4a7" id="a4a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I am not afraid anymore.</p><p name="199f" id="199f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because I have documented everything.<br>I have written my truth.<br>And I have the quiet strength of those who know what pain is—and choose not to pass it on.</p><p name="bcba" id="bcba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🌱 What Comes Next</p><p name="d06c" id="d06c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe you’ve cried in public too.<br>Maybe you’ve been dismissed when you were desperate.<br>Maybe you’ve felt like the world doesn’t know what to do with someone who’s hurting.</p><p name="2d40" id="2d40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To you, I say:</p><p name="9e1f" id="9e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; You deserved better. We all do. And we can do better.</p><p name="70bb" id="70bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It starts with remembering something basic:</p><p name="f075" id="f075" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; When someone is crying, you don’t escalate.<br>You soften.<br>You wait.<br>You make space.</p><p name="3042" id="3042" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not because a policy tells you to.<br>But because it’s what humans do.</p><p name="1e98" id="1e98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🕊️ Final Words</p><p name="bafe" id="bafe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t about coffee anymore.</p><p name="260b" id="260b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s about what kind of world we want to live in.<br>And whether there is still room for people like me—people like all of us—who just need a moment of peace without being punished for it.</p><p name="892d" id="892d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks, you could have just been kind.<br>Instead, you taught me what it feels like to be othered for having a heart.</p><p name="46aa" id="46aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I still believe in gentleness.<br>And I will keep writing, until the world remembers it too.</p><p name="d2f6" id="d2f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright <br>The Bodhisattva of Woodland</p></div></div></section>
