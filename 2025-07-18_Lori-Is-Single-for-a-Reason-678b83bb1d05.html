When Bigotry Wears Lipstick and Calls It “Old School”

She doesn’t “do pronouns.” She’s looking for a man who buys gold bars, hates vaccines, and wants a woman who considers her job irrelevant—because to her, being financially taken care of is part of “old school” romance.</p><p name="c2e8" id="c2e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’s not alone.<br>And that should terrify you.</p><p name="afea" id="afea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the surface, Lori is just another Tinder profile—a snapshot of a woman looking for love, or maybe control, wrapped in a few carefully curated beliefs. But dig even an inch deeper, and what you find is more than just a set of preferences. It’s an ideological manifesto, beamed through the dating app algorithm, targeting a very specific kind of man and rejecting everything—and everyone—else.</p><p name="a1e0" id="a1e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s be clear: Lori isn’t looking for love.<br>She’s looking for a co-conspirator in her worldview.<br>And that worldview is toxic.</p><p name="110c" id="110c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Weaponized Nostalgia and the Faux Comfort of “Old School”</p><p name="d283" id="d283" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The phrase “old school” shows up three times in Lori’s short bio. But it’s not a throwback to 90s mixtapes or handwritten letters. It’s a dog whistle. It means rigid gender roles, anti-LGBTQ+ exclusion, and a romanticization of an era where women were expected to stay quiet, stay pretty, and stay dependent.</p><p name="29d6" id="29d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The past she&#39;s glorifying wasn&#39;t kind to everyone—it was brutal to most.<br>Especially anyone queer, trans, poor, non-white, or just different.</p><p name="ba98" id="ba98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But Lori doesn’t want to reckon with that.<br>She wants to cosplay as a damsel waiting for her bullion-hoarding prince, while ignoring the fires her ideology helps light in the real world.</p><p name="425e" id="425e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I Don’t Do Pronouns” — The Quiet Screaming of Violent Ideology</p><p name="4674" id="4674" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s stop sugarcoating this.<br>When someone says “I don’t do pronouns,” what they mean is:</p><p name="8bb9" id="8bb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “I refuse to recognize the humanity of trans and nonbinary people.”</p><p name="520c" id="520c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not a quirk.<br>It’s not “free thinking.”<br>It’s a small act of daily violence.</p><p name="551d" id="551d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It tells you that Lori’s identity is built not on love or self-awareness—but on opposition, on exclusion, on fear. And when paired with her refusal to date anyone vaccinated during a global pandemic, it’s clear that facts, compassion, and communal responsibility are optional in her world.</p><p name="c707" id="c707" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just personal preference.<br>It’s a worldview dressed up as romance.</p><p name="4e17" id="4e17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lori Is Single for a Reason</p><p name="34c1" id="34c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not because she’s 57.<br>Not because she has standards.<br>Not because she’s “too real” for modern dating.</p><p name="b474" id="b474" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’s single because her entire framework for connection is built around rejection, paranoia, and control. You cannot love deeply when your ideology insists on hierarchy. You cannot partner authentically if your goal is domination—whether financial, political, or cultural.</p><p name="0288" id="0288" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’s single because her world is too small for love to breathe.</p><p name="845e" id="845e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Real Free Thinkers Are Out Here Building Bridges</p><p name="f751" id="f751" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While Lori sneers at pronouns and praises unvaccinated masculinity, the rest of us are out here trying to survive, connect, grow. We’re learning what it means to unlearn bias. We’re discovering the radical vulnerability it takes to truly see another human being—not as a role, not as a category, but as a person.</p><p name="458f" id="458f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lori says she wants a free thinker.<br>But freedom—real freedom—requires humility.<br>And Lori’s fortress of certainty has no room for doubt, growth, or compassion.</p><p name="e47f" id="e47f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Love Letter to the Ones Who Know Better</p><p name="21f2" id="21f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the humans who still believe that kindness matters more than gold.<br>To the ones who understand that gender, identity, and truth aren’t threats—they’re miracles.<br>To the people building lives on consent, equality, and unflinching humanity—</p><p name="575b" id="575b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thank you. You are the reason we’re not doomed.<br>You’re not single because you’re broken.<br>You’re single because the Lori-verse is collapsing under its own self-righteous weight.</p><p name="ef88" id="ef88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let it.<br>And swipe on.</p><p name="38bc" id="38bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Oh, and by the way Lori, the plural of bullion is bullion, not bullions. That was the first thing I noticed. You’ve never seen bullion in your life, and you are LARPing richness.</em></p><figure name="ff99" id="ff99" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*txiNGKMW3UWolcv_TLOk3w.png" data-width="720" data-height="1045" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*txiNGKMW3UWolcv_TLOk3w.png"></figure></div></div></section>
