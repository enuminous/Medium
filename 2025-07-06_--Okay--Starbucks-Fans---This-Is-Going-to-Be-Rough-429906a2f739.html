Let’s not kid ourselves — ADA accommodation requests are increasing, especially from neurodivergent customers. Some are legitimate, some are more... complex. Either way, it’s legal exposure, and we don’t want store-level people improvising responses.</p><p name="aaf2" id="aaf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">RAJ (Systems):<br>Right. So what we’ve mapped out is a routing system that contains complaints in Tier 1 — fully scripted — with no discretionary power. Escalations are algorithmically discouraged. And critically, we mandate modality control.</p><p name="c1bd" id="c1bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER (Legal):<br>Explain that part again?</p><p name="30a0" id="30a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">RAJ:<br>When a written request comes in, we transition the user to a phone-based engagement model. It allows us to filter out requestors who aren’t serious or are difficult to manage over voice. And legally, phone leaves less trace than email — it’s a soft containment layer.</p><p name="d31d" id="d31d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TRINA (Accessibility):<br>Hold on. That’s not ADA compliant for folks with phone-related disability barriers. You’re knowingly excluding people who explicitly say they can’t use the phone.</p><p name="424a" id="424a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER:<br>Technically, we’re offering them a path. If they decline to use it, they’re the ones stepping off the process. We’re not refusing—we’re structuring.</p><p name="c954" id="c954" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SHELLEY (Strategy):<br>Let’s be clear: this isn’t just about legality. It’s about brand protection. We cannot have Twitter threads popping off every time someone demands a special process. We need the appearance of fairness without opening up every single case.</p><p name="5ea3" id="5ea3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA:<br>Exactly. Our risk analysis shows that fewer than 3% of ADA-based complaints sustain momentum past three emails if we maintain the “please call us” barrier.</p><p name="4893" id="4893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TRINA:<br>But we’re knowingly exhausting people with legitimate claims.</p><p name="cf1e" id="cf1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER:<br>Yes. That’s... the tradeoff. No one’s proud of it. But litigation risk is weighted against compliance noise. If we over-accommodate, we create precedent. If we under-accommodate but keep it procedural, we create... attrition.</p><p name="f1ed" id="f1ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">RAJ:<br>And the data supports this model. Every system is a funnel. We’re shaping this one to avoid policy rewrite.</p><p name="43c5" id="43c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SHELLEY:<br>Can we say we’re working on it? Something like: “Thank you for reaching out. We’re in the process of sorting this out.”</p><p name="7558" id="7558" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA:<br>That’s our empathy buffer. It satisfies sentiment metrics while keeping resolution open-ended. It scores high on deflection without sounding cold.</p><p name="bbaf" id="bbaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TRINA:<br>So we’re creating an illusion of resolution?</p><p name="6184" id="6184" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER:<br>We’re protecting the brand from legal exposure by appearing compliant.</p><p name="6cd8" id="6cd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SHELLEY:<br>And if someone breaks through the funnel?</p><p name="c0c2" id="c0c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA:<br>Then we settle. Quietly. But it’ll be rare.</p><p name="67c6" id="67c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">RAJ:<br>We’ll monitor for public blowback and flag any repeated names that reach escalation thresholds.</p><p name="de21" id="de21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TRINA (quietly):<br>And if the person’s right?</p><p name="8e3a" id="8e3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Silence.)</p><p name="9cba" id="9cba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER:<br>Then we have a record showing we followed procedure.</p><p name="27f8" id="27f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA:<br>We’re not here to solve justice. We’re here to manage it.</p><p name="316a" id="316a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, the group begins to game out hypotheticals, modeling risk scenarios. Their discussion turns speculative but realistic, blending PR risk, legal mitigation, and internal ethics calculations.</p><p name="9010" id="9010" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER (Legal):<br>Okay. Let’s game this out. Let’s say someone is right. Let’s say they were discriminated against, and they actually know what they’re doing. Not just angry—smart, documented, maybe even connected.</p><p name="1b92" id="1b92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SHELLEY (Brand):<br>Like what, a journalist? A lawyer?</p><p name="0d52" id="0d52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA (Risk):<br>Worse — a whistleblower. Or someone who publishes. Medium, X, TikTok. Doesn’t matter. If they frame the story as civil rights suppression? That’s a reputational fire we can’t contain with a Tier 1 script.</p><p name="0111" id="0111" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">RAJ (Systems):<br>Let me offer a technical possibility: we could tag high-risk escalation patterns using natural language sentiment. If someone mentions “ADA,” “lawyer,” or “public disclosure,” we flag it for silent escalation. Add a human buffer.</p><p name="f994" id="f994" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TRINA:<br>And then what? Do we actually fix the situation, or just adjust tone?</p><p name="bb4b" id="bb4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SHELLEY:<br>We perform responsiveness. Maybe loop in a VP. Issue an apology without admitting fault. Empathy video, if needed. “Starbucks deeply regrets…”</p><p name="a16f" id="a16f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER:<br>…but no admission of noncompliance. That’s the line.</p><p name="33a4" id="33a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">💭 HYPOTHETICAL: What if the complainant is high-profile?</p><p name="5075" id="5075" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA:<br>Alright. Hypothetical two: What if the complainant is someone with credentials? Say, a physicist. Academic. Maybe even involved in something big — like AGI, AI ethics, something we’re already PR-vulnerable on.</p><p name="17d3" id="17d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SHELLEY:<br>If that hits the news cycle—“Starbucks violates ADA rights of scientist building AGI”—we’re not dealing with an internal complaint anymore. We’re dealing with culture war shrapnel.</p><p name="e9db" id="e9db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER:<br>Then we settle. Fast. Quietly. No NDA, or it looks like a cover-up. Just resolve and diffuse.</p><p name="9e23" id="9e23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">RAJ:<br>Should I model a notification system for “named threat vectors”? Like, flag if a user has an online presence, publications, whistleblower keywords?</p><p name="276f" id="276f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA:<br>Build it. Quietly.</p><p name="8704" id="8704" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">💭 HYPOTHETICAL: What if they publish everything?</p><p name="a0d0" id="a0d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TRINA:<br>Worst case? They don’t sue. They publish. They lay out the entire system: the procedural delay, the modality filter, the scripted responses, the empathy loops. They connect it to systemic ableism and call it designed discrimination.</p><p name="db96" id="db96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SHELLEY:<br>Then we’re not defending policy. We’re defending the morality of the machine. And we’ll lose that fight.</p><p name="b144" id="b144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PETER:<br>If it gets that far, someone in senior leadership will take the fall. Maybe restructure the customer care org. Pledge reform. Classic damage control.</p><p name="6216" id="6216" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LINDA:<br>What do we really lose if we’re exposed?</p><p name="8aac" id="8aac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TRINA:<br>Trust.
