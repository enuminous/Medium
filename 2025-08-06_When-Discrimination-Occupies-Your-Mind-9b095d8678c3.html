It’s the harm of having your mental space taken over by something you never asked for, never wanted, and should never have had to endure in the first place.</p><p name="d0c9" id="d0c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since the incident at my local Starbucks — when I was denied a cup of water and treated in a way that violated my rights as an autistic and disabled person — my brain has not been able to let go of it. This is not by choice. This is not a quirk of personality. It is the entirely predictable consequence of being placed under repeated psychological threat in the same environment where I should be safe to exist.</p><h3 name="2bde" id="2bde" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Cognitive Loop</h3><p name="249e" id="249e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Mental health professionals have a name for this: intrusive thought patterns and rumination cycles. Once triggered by an event of perceived injustice or humiliation — especially one involving discrimination — the mind can replay the incident over and over, analyzing it from every angle. This is a form of hypervigilance: the brain’s attempt to learn from a threat and prepare for it happening again.</p><p name="da48" id="da48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the threat is not resolved but repeated — as it was when I returned to the same location and was denied water again, even after explaining the prior discrimination — the loop intensifies. The brain begins to prioritize the threat as a matter requiring constant attention. This is not obsession for its own sake. This is a survival mechanism that has been forcibly engaged.</p><h3 name="6354" id="6354" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Displacement of Daily Life</h3><p name="8bb8" id="8bb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This loop has taken up an outsized share of my cognitive resources. Time I should be spending on work, relationships, and personal projects is instead spent thinking about the incident, the people involved, and the next steps to protect myself. Even when I am not actively engaged with it, the mental background noise is still there, like an engine idling in the back of my mind.</p><p name="54d6" id="54d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is functional impairment. It disrupts concentration, planning, and emotional regulation. It increases stress load and diminishes resilience. These are measurable effects — not abstract complaints.</p><h3 name="dc4d" id="dc4d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Avoidable Nature of This Harm</h3><p name="0833" id="0833" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What makes this harm worse is that it was entirely avoidable.<br>At any point today, staff at that location could have chosen to treat me with basic respect, acknowledge my disability, and provide the simple accommodation of water. Instead, they chose to act in a way that directly reinforced the original injury, even after being warned that I had already filed with the Justice Department a Title III complaint for the original discrimination.</p><p name="8f41" id="8f41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This has forced me into a state of defensive living with respect to a public business I should be able to access without fear or heightened alertness. That is a profound shift in my sense of safety and belonging in my own community.</p><h3 name="051a" id="051a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why This Matters</h3><p name="d293" id="d293" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When discrimination doesn’t end at the moment it happens, but follows a person into their thoughts, their schedule, and their decision-making, it becomes something larger. It becomes an occupier of mental real estate — a presence that sits in the mind like an uninvited tenant.</p><p name="8aa9" id="8aa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That occupation is the harm. It is the theft of peace of mind. And it was inflicted by people who had both the power and the opportunity to prevent it.</p><h3 name="f7e3" id="f7e3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">To Reiterate</h3><p name="a818" id="a818" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">An employee of Starbucks called the police on me for sitting quietly, crying with a cup of water, on April 18th.</p><p name="0817" id="0817" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Even the police were irked at the time; they recognized that it was a junk call, they let me go with no incident, after I explained to them that I was autistic and controlling my emotions, and Starbucks had decided to be the aggressor. They shrugged it off. They knew that I wasn’t causing any harm. The three police officers will make capable witnesses to this discrimination. I’m certain the police call from Starbucks to the dispatch was recorded. I’m interested to know what the employee actually said about me when she called 911? It could have been worse: an actual police emergency could have happened at the same time they were otherwise occupied, maybe a life and death situation, and these three officers wouldn’t have been available? Who knows?</p></div></div></section>
