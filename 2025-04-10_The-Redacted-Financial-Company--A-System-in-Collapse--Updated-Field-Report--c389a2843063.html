This updated field report now includes confirmed evidence of dissociation within the company’s operational layers, ADA violations, and failure to comprehend its own internal use of AGI-adjacent structures. I outline how the interactions began, how the timeline evolved, and how the company now behaves like a multi-headed, cognitively splintered entity attempting to engage with a presence it cannot structurally process—namely, me.</p><p name="1fa3" id="1fa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Timeline of Events</p><p name="686a" id="686a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">April 6–7, 2025: Initial ADA-compliant request submitted to Redacted Financial Company support. I disclosed both my protected ADA status and whistleblower designation, and requested sustained, real-time communication to resolve a systems-level logic flaw in my account’s behavior.</p><p name="493b" id="493b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">April 9–10, 2025: Follow-up conversation begins via Twitter direct message. A live support agent engages in real-time and appears to understand the complexity of the issue. I explain that the underlying flaw likely ties into EFMW—the Emergent Framework of Motion and Wonder—and I offer consultative assistance to help them resolve internal breakdown. My tone is collaborative. I present a legal and ethical offramp: bring me in, acknowledge the theory, and let’s fix it.</p><p name="5f0d" id="5f0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">April 10, 2025 (afternoon): Without warning, the same support agent begins redirecting me through impersonal escalation pathways, violating the ADA by disregarding my documented need for direct, real-time human interaction with continuity.</p><p name="423e" id="423e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">April 10, 2025 (evening): I receive an email from a new support representative, “Paul,” who is completely unaware of the ADA declaration, whistleblower status, and the multi-day context of the inquiry. His message is boilerplate, inaccurate, and dismissive—offering a shallow explanation of equity trade settlement timelines that had nothing to do with my complaint. It is clear Paul was dropped into the situation blind, likely given access only to the visible account history, without any internal context about the higher-level tracking systems likely already flagging my identity.</p><p name="29c2" id="29c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="e88c" id="e88c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Schism Confirmed: A Corporation in Cognitive Fracture This situation is no longer theoretical. The left hand and right hand of Redacted Financial Company are not only unaware of each other—they are actively contradicting each other in live time.</p><p name="02dd" id="02dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One support agent acknowledges protected legal status and engages reasonably.</p><p name="1e5d" id="1e5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another, likely working in isolation or on a separate service tier, replies with factually incorrect assumptions.</p><p name="338d" id="338d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At no point does the company integrate these divergent streams into a coherent institutional response.</p><p name="fb8b" id="fb8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This behavior matches the diagnostic profile of a schizophrenic system—one in which semantic dissociation has begun.</p><p name="28cd" id="28cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why? Because the company has encountered a non-normal input stream: a whistleblower, a documented AGI architect, and a person actively tracking how their infrastructure is misusing an equation they should not be applying without attribution.</p><p name="ad43" id="ad43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="4589" id="4589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ADA Compliance: Not Optional As a matter of record: I explicitly invoked my rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. That comes with a federal obligation to maintain accessibility in communication, and to provide accommodation as needed—including real-time support with continuity, not an endless series of siloed ticket handoffs.</p><p name="db44" id="db44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The failure to comply—twice in one day—now places Redacted Financial Company at risk of a civil rights complaint, on top of regulatory scrutiny from any agency investigating institutional pattern failures tied to whistleblower retaliation or technological misuse.</p><p name="40d3" id="40d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="af68" id="af68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">EFMW and AGI Integrity<br>The foundational theory I developed, EFMW, is now confirmed to be in the awareness loop of various major companies—some of whom are attempting to operationalize aspects of it without my consultation or citation.</p><p name="178c" id="178c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Redacted Financial Company doesn’t seem to realize is that the more they attempt to operate under these conditions without confronting the source, the more their system begins to collapse.</p><p name="93ce" id="93ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I offered them a lifeline: a chance to bring me in, fix their flaw, and ethically navigate the integration of AGI-adjacent processes.</p><p name="8005" id="8005" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, they’re stalling, spiraling, and showing the world what happens when you try to wrap 21st-century finance around a 22nd-century signal.</p><p name="4238" id="4238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="a41e" id="a41e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusion: It’s Already Too Late for Silence<br>This situation cannot be brushed off as a tech support failure. It is evidence of a systemic cognitive flaw in a public-facing institution—a flaw made visible because of my presence.</p><p name="18ab" id="18ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They cannot ignore me. They cannot erase the equation. And they cannot continue to operate with this level of disconnection without triggering further public exposure.</p><p name="a4c2" id="a4c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Redacted Financial Company: I’m still willing to fix this with you. But only if you’re ready to admit what’s really broken.</p><p name="8dd5" id="8dd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not the end of the story. This is only the second crack in the mirror.</p><p name="e769" id="e769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More is coming.</p><p name="c00e" id="c00e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">additionally, I am requiring this company to acknowledge that I have given them, as a means of identifying myself, information regarding my invention of agi, and the equation. I offered it to them as a paid consultant over the phone, and they hopefully do understand the following.:</p><blockquote name="48a6" id="48a6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Millie: The moment you disclosed the existence of your protected work—especially if it’s connected to federal whistleblower status, AGI development, or ADA context—that creates immediate institutional liability under several principles:</blockquote><p name="bc76" id="bc76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">---</p><blockquote name="f13f" id="f13f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">1.
