My 17 Days in Psychiatric Retaliation

Not because I was a danger to myself or others, not because I was incoherent, but because I was a federally protected whistleblower who dared to keep speaking out.</p><p name="4247" id="4247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the very first moment, I told every police officer and every doctor exactly who I was: a physicist working in quantum physics, a published researcher, and a federally protected whistleblower. I had paper documentation in my pocket proving it. I explained it calmly and directly, in detail. And every word of that explanation is preserved — on police bodycams and in the backseat recordings of squad cars — because I refused to let them erase the truth.</p><p name="6fd1" id="6fd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They ignored me. Worse — they weaponized psychiatric law against me.</p><p name="699b" id="699b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="7f4e" id="7f4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The First 5150</p><p name="ace8" id="ace8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first time, I was detained despite calmly explaining my physics research and whistleblower protections. I spoke rationally, coherently, about mathematics, about the risks I was exposing, about the reality of my work. Yet I was carted off, stripped of rights, and treated like a criminal for telling the truth. I even carried a wallet card explaining I was working in high clearance physics, and was not to be 5150’ed, that I had competent therapists and was not a danger to myself or others. despite all of this, I was handcuffed, injured, transported against my will, and held on lockdown, and then denied my normal dose of medicine.</p><p name="faf0" id="faf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On video, in the police car, I am not raving or incoherent. I am explaining physics. And yet, I was locked away anyway.</p><p name="938f" id="938f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="da71" id="da71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Second 5150</p><p name="9342" id="9342" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It happened again. Another psychiatric hold. Another cycle of abuse. More days stripped from my life. In total, 17 days behind locked doors in facilities where I did not belong, forced into silence while my whistleblowing was being buried.</p><p name="2595" id="2595" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, I told everyone: the officers, the clinicians, the doctors — “I am a federally protected whistleblower. You are retaliating against me.” They all heard it. They all chose to ignore it.</p><p name="e4cc" id="e4cc" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="09f6" id="09f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Pattern of Retaliation</p><p name="04f8" id="04f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This wasn’t a mistake. This was retaliation, plain and simple.</p><p name="b293" id="b293" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is a playbook used against whistleblowers: if you cannot discredit the facts, you try to discredit the person. You call them “unstable.” You weaponize mental health laws like California’s 5150 to silence dissent and undermine credibility.</p><p name="5333" id="5333" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was sane. I was rational. I was explaining quantum physics and whistleblower protections. And they locked me up anyway. That is not psychiatry — that is abuse of power.</p><p name="5ea5" id="5ea5" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="2d96" id="2d96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why This Matters</p><p name="57ee" id="57ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a physicist. I am a whistleblower. And I was confined to psychiatric wards for telling the truth.</p><p name="15ee" id="15ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it can happen to me — with my published work, my congressional contacts, my whistleblower status — it can happen to anyone who challenges power. This is not just my story; it is a national security issue and a civil rights issue.</p><p name="b83e" id="b83e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whistleblowers should be protected, not punished.</p><p name="d8ce" id="d8ce" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="8434" id="8434" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Evidence Exists</p><p name="844b" id="844b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The proof is out there. The police bodycams. The squad car recordings. The facility intake notes and discharge papers. They all show the same thing: I was calm, coherent, sane — and retaliated against anyway.</p><p name="e961" id="e961" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those tapes must be preserved. The public deserves to see them.</p><p name="5176" id="5176" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="63ee" id="63ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My Demand</p><p name="8b98" id="8b98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want accountability for those who abused psychiatric law to silence me. I want recognition that whistleblowers are being targeted not just with smears or harassment, but with forced psychiatric confinement.</p><p name="9753" id="9753" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I am not crazy. I am a physicist. I am a federally protected whistleblower. And I am angry — because what happened to me was not just an attack on me. It was an attack on the truth itself.</p></div></div></section><section name="6e3f" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1dd0" id="1dd0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I know several other AGI researchers who have also been subjected to similar treatment and are willing to testify.</em></p><p name="627d" id="627d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
