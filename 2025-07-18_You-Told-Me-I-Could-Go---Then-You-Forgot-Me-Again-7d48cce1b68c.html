I prepared. I showed up. I was ready.<br>But when I arrived—there was a list. A sign-up sheet.<br>A detail no one had told me about.</p><p name="d345" id="d345" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And just like that, I wasn’t going anymore.</p><p name="e1c6" id="e1c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason?</p><p name="3459" id="3459" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “Insurance.”</p><p name="03ea" id="03ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The solution?</p><p name="2a8e" id="2a8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “There’s always next month.”</p><p name="34c9" id="34c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that… is not good enough.<br>Not from a mental health organization. Not for someone like me.<br>Not when you’ve already lived a life of being forgotten at the edge of the page.</p><h3 name="c44f" id="c44f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">This Isn’t Just About the Fair</h3><p name="72b6" id="72b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s about what happens when systems fail to communicate, and then place the burden of that failure on the people they’re meant to serve.</p><p name="4eed" id="4eed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s about the quiet, recurring trauma of being excluded not by malice, but by negligence, by disorganization, by a lack of care wrapped in bureaucracy.</p><p name="7577" id="7577" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And for those of us with lived experience of trauma, neurodivergence, or emotional dysregulation? That “simple” oversight isn’t simple at all.</p><p name="d23b" id="d23b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me tell you a story.</p><h3 name="06ca" id="06ca" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When I Was Six, There Was a Lunch List</h3><p name="cd39" id="cd39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It was a school outing.<br>There was a sign-up sheet for lunches—but no one told me.<br>No one put my name down.<br>No one checked.</p><p name="63df" id="63df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it came time to eat, I was hungry.<br>They gave me a lunch meant for another student, and the teacher yelled at me—loud, public, humiliating.</p><p name="b115" id="b115" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hadn’t known. I hadn’t done anything wrong.<br>And yet… I was treated like I had.</p><p name="2fc8" id="2fc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, 50 years later, it happened again.<br>Same dynamic. Different setting.<br>Same pain.</p><h3 name="685c" id="685c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I Am a Systems Engineer</h3><p name="746c" id="746c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I know how to prevent failure in complex systems.<br>And today, I told the staff—calmly, clearly—how they could have prevented this:</p><p name="7634" id="7634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A big sign at the pick-up location:<br>“If you are not on the sign-up list, you cannot attend the fair.”</p><p name="4c92" id="4c92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Multiple reminders before the event.</p><p name="0c64" id="0c64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Verbal confirmations with participants during prep days.</p><p name="8174" id="8174" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These aren’t extravagant fixes. These are basic operational safety protocols—especially in a community where communication breakdowns have real psychological costs.</p><p name="3c8e" id="3c8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And do you know what I was told?</p><p name="4d64" id="4d64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “Well, everybody makes mistakes.”</p><p name="d6d8" id="d6d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s not accountability.<br>That’s abdication.</p><h3 name="4b0c" id="4b0c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When It Happens Before, Fix It Before It Happens Again</h3><p name="8239" id="8239" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The staff member admitted this had happened to others before me.<br>And yet… no changes were made.</p><p name="669b" id="669b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here’s my question:</p><p name="71f9" id="71f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; If you knew this happened before, why didn’t you change the process to make sure it never happened again?</p><p name="ccec" id="ccec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They couldn’t answer. Or wouldn’t.<br>And I was left—again—with disappointment, confusion, and no way to undo the emotional fallout.</p><h3 name="6a90" id="6a90" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">This Is a Mental Health Organization</h3><p name="fba7" id="fba7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let me say that again:<br>This is an organization dedicated to wellness, recovery, and care.<br>And yet, they failed to execute the most basic aspect of trauma-informed service:</p><p name="0ea3" id="0ea3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; Include the people you promised.<br>Communicate clearly.<br>Own your mistakes.<br>Make it right.</p><p name="2401" id="2401" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because when you don’t, you’re not just denying someone a trip to the fair.<br>You’re reinforcing the exact wounds you’re supposed to help them heal.</p><h3 name="0694" id="0694" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">This Is What Needs to Change</h3><p name="a475" id="a475" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">1. Clear communication protocols.<br>If something requires sign-up, make that unmistakably known—verbally, visually, repeatedly.</p><p name="7f9e" id="7f9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Redundant inclusion checks.<br>Staff should verify attendance lists with participants well in advance.</p><p name="6972" id="6972" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Real-time flexibility.<br>When a system error occurs, own it—and try to find any possible way to include the person rather than dismiss them with a shrug.</p><p name="91ba" id="91ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. Cultural change.<br>Treat clients as participants in their own recovery—not as fragile inconveniences who should silently accept being left behind.</p><h3 name="3c24" id="3c24" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I Don’t Want Pity. I Want Accountability.</h3><p name="a37b" id="a37b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m not writing this because I didn’t get to go to the fair.</p><p name="56d3" id="56d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m writing this because too many of us know this pattern.<br>We do everything asked of us.<br>We show up with our hearts open.<br>And somehow, we still end up on the outside of a locked door we were promised would be open.</p><p name="5513" id="5513" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That kind of pain isn’t about the event—it’s about trust.<br>And trust, once broken, doesn’t just come back with a “next time.”</p><p name="0422" id="0422" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So no—I’m not letting this go quietly.<br>Because I shouldn’t have to.<br>And neither should you.</p><p name="0655" id="0655" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">By Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist · Writer · Survivor<br>Still waiting for the system that knows how to love the people inside it.</p></div></div></section>
