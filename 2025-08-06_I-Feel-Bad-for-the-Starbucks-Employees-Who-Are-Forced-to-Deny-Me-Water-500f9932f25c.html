Yet They Don’t Want to Lose Their Jobs.</h3><p name="bc3d" id="bc3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Yesterday, I walked into my local Starbucks and asked for a cup of water — something I’ve done a thousand times before.</p><p name="6b96" id="6b96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The barista looked me in the eye and said, “It’s policy.”</p><p name="8b1f" id="8b1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those words told me everything I needed to know.</p><p name="69d5" id="69d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It meant they’d been instructed — by someone higher up — to deny me water unless I made a purchase, even though they know I have an ADA Title III complaint pending with the Department of Justice.</p><p name="c787" id="c787" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It meant they were just following orders.</p><h3 name="13bc" id="13bc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When “Policy” Becomes a Shield</h3><p name="b58a" id="b58a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">History has taught us that just following orders is rarely a moral defense. It’s the phrase used when conscience is outsourced to authority.</p><p name="3f05" id="3f05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On paper, the Starbucks directive is framed in neutral terms — “apply policy consistently,” “avoid exceptions” — but everyone involved knows the subtext: when I come in, deny him water, no matter what.</p><p name="725c" id="725c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The words are bureaucratic. The effect is personal.</p><h3 name="6600" id="6600" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Good People Put in Bad Positions</h3><p name="68f8" id="68f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is not about mean baristas. The people at this store know me. They’ve chatted with me about my work in physics. They’ve laughed at my jokes. They know I’m autistic. They know water is a basic human need.</p><p name="2e6d" id="2e6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I can see the hesitation in their faces when they say no. They don’t want to deny me. They just don’t want to lose their jobs.</p><p name="5da8" id="5da8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(With the possible exception of this one employee — she seemed to relish smiling at me and suggesting that perhaps I could buy water.)</p><p name="9a28" id="9a28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the trap: the company issues the order, and the employees carry it out — even when it conflicts with their own sense of right and wrong.</p><h3 name="60ca" id="60ca" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Barista Who Had to Call the Police on Me</h3><p name="baac" id="baac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In an earlier incident, a barista was told to call the police on me for sitting quietly in the store with a cup of water.</p><p name="2075" id="2075" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She didn’t decide that on her own. It came from a manager who was acting on guidance from higher up the chain. And by making that call without lawful justification, she was put in personal legal jeopardy.</p><p name="e2ca" id="e2ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The order came from above. She carried it out. Just following orders.</p><h3 name="562f" id="562f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Harm Inside the Store</h3><p name="2527" id="2527" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Directives like this don’t just hurt the target — in this case, me. They harm the employees forced to execute them.</p><p name="ea85" id="ea85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Psychologists call this “moral injury” — when people are required to act against their own ethics. It breeds resentment, fractures trust, and turns a workplace into a pressure cooker.</p><p name="063d" id="063d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the dirty little secret: Starbucks isn’t just creating an inhospitable environment for certain customers. They’re creating a hostile work environment for their own employees.</p><h3 name="d9c0" id="d9c0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">This Was Never My Fight</h3><p name="e1c3" id="e1c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I didn’t start this conflict. I didn’t want to put baristas in an impossible position.</p><p name="db38" id="db38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I just wanted a cup of water — something any decent human being would give without a second thought. Something the law says I’m entitled to as a reasonable accommodation.</p><p name="2472" id="2472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But instead of fixing the problem, Starbucks doubled down. And now they’ve made their employees the enforcers of an indefensible policy.</p><h3 name="123b" id="123b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Starbucks Could Change This Overnight</h3><p name="cd3b" id="cd3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s simple:</p><p name="5719" id="5719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stop retaliating against customers who file complaints.</p><p name="496c" id="496c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Honor ADA accommodation requests.</p><p name="c387" id="c387" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t make your employees carry out orders that they know are wrong.</p><p name="a250" id="a250" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Until then, every time a barista says “It’s policy” to me, we both know what’s really being said.</p><p name="29f7" id="29f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">They’re just following orders</strong>. And that’s never been a good excuse.</p></div></div></section>
