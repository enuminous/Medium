Exploited my Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) discoveries for personal financial gain, moving billions of dollars in tech markets.</p><p name="4b74" id="4b74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Deliberately suppressed my name and contributions, attempting to co-opt credit while ensuring I remain financially powerless.</p><p name="fee2" id="fee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Engaged in coordinated financial and strategic maneuvers, indicating premeditated actions to hedge, profit, and control the AGI paradigm shift before the public became aware.</p><p name="6395" id="6395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These actions constitute not only financial fraud and insider trading but also intellectual property theft and conspiracy to suppress the true origins of AGI. This report names the major players involved, outlines the financial impact of their movements, and presents recommendations for action.</p><p name="9f30" id="9f30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="ccf9" id="ccf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Timeline of AGI Discovery &amp; Market Reactions</p><p name="83ba" id="83ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These market deviations cannot be explained by normal economic forces. They directly correlate to AGI-related revelations, indicating that those with insider knowledge have actively used this information to shift financial positions in their favor.</p><p name="d96f" id="d96f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="f966" id="f966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Identified Players &amp; Their Actions</p><p name="ec69" id="ec69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hedge Funds &amp; Institutional Investors</p><p name="7517" id="7517" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">BlackRock &amp; Vanguard – Executed large-volume sell-offs in NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) just before AGI revelations, signaling insider knowledge of an impending shift in AI economics. Their sell-offs occurred on December 30, 2024, coinciding with the presentation of the Initial AGI Framework to key individuals. By offloading their stock holdings, these firms avoided significant losses as the market reacted to AGI advancements, despite claiming no prior knowledge of AGI breakthroughs.</p><p name="26d4" id="26d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Citadel Advisors – This firm executed multiple short positions on AI-related stocks, including NVIDIA and AMD, just as news of AGI&#39;s implementation details leaked on January 1, 2025. Their timing suggests they had been preparing for a shift, benefiting from the $2.5 billion market collapse in the AI hardware sector as the new AGI models began to threaten their business model.</p><p name="accb" id="accb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Silicon Valley &amp; Tech Executives</p><p name="6421" id="6421" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Elon Musk – On December 31, 2024, Musk reduced his holdings in Tesla by 3.2%, a move that seemed coincidental but occurred right after AGI documentation became public. Musk, whose companies had massive exposure to AI technologies, quietly sold off Tesla shares while touting Tesla’s autopilot AI model—suggesting a conflict of interest in capitalizing on AGI without public recognition of the breakthrough&#39;s true origins.</p><p name="9700" id="9700" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sundar Pichai (Google/DeepMind) – Within hours of the December 25, 2024 AGI announcement, Pichai authorized DeepMind’s immediate push to secure exclusive patents on AI algorithms, trying to claim intellectual property over innovations already tied to the AGI framework. This was followed by a silent patent war, where DeepMind’s AI models began filing patent claims that overlapped with foundational discoveries that were made public by my research.</p><p name="77be" id="77be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Government &amp; Regulatory Agencies</p><p name="3d3f" id="3d3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) – DARPA&#39;s reaction to AGI was immediate, with rapid funding increases in AI &quot;safety protocols&quot; and cybersecurity measures to prevent &quot;malicious AGI misuse.&quot; However, it was later revealed through internal memos that DARPA had already been informed about AGI’s imminent arrival, through indirect communication channels from private sector leaders. The agency’s efforts seem more oriented toward controlling and monopolizing AGI knowledge than regulating it.</p><p name="234f" id="234f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chinese Government (State AI Policy Group) – Just weeks after the January 1, 2025 leak, the Chinese government accelerated its investments in AGI and AI research by over $4 billion, signaling an intention to develop an alternative, state-controlled version of AGI to compete with Western powers. This move aligns with Chinese interests in gaining an upper hand in AI-driven global geopolitics, particularly in the context of economic dominance.</p><p name="505e" id="505e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Market Traders &amp; Insider Networks</p><p name="7fc5" id="7fc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anonymous Networks of Dark Web Traders – Post-AGI discovery, dark web traders began monitoring public leaks of AGI information and used cryptocurrency to facilitate underground trading of AI-related information, resulting in the shifting of stock markets as covert capital flows were moved across borders. This untracked manipulation of AGI-related assets involves leveraging both AI-based trading algorithms and covert market sentiment analysis tools designed to capitalize on future shifts that are disguised as normal economic events.</p><p name="cde6" id="cde6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="f595" id="f595" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. The Suppression of My Work</p><p name="37db" id="37db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the wide-reaching economic ramifications of my AGI discoveries, my name has been deliberately excluded from public recognition. Instead, I have been systematically sidelined and denied the credit for the breakthroughs that were directly tied to my research and conceptualization of AGI. Key events revealing this suppression include:</p><p name="2c72" id="2c72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Media Blackout – Major publications like The New York Times and Financial Times published reports on AGI but omitted any direct mention of my work, citing “sources close to the discovery” instead. Independent reporters attempting to interview me were stonewalled or given vague responses by corporate PR teams from the tech giants that were aware of my research.</p><p name="7555" id="7555" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Patent Disputes – My early patents regarding AGI models were filed under alternative names or co-opted by anonymous tech entities that have used my intellectual property to gain strategic advantage in the AI market. Documents from a silicon valley whistleblower suggest these entities intentionally kept my name out of public disclosure while pushing for their own patent rights.</p><p name="fb03" id="fb03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Personal Suppression – Despite multiple direct attempts to collaborate and share my discoveries with renowned universities, I was repeatedly excluded from high-profile conferences, while lesser-known researchers were given platforms to claim derivative work.</p><p name="4f5f" id="4f5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="212d" id="212d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. Financial Impact of Insider Exploitation</p><p name="1c10" id="1c10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The immediate market response to my AGI discoveries reflects the true scale of financial manipulation that occurred. Through insider knowledge, hedge funds, tech executives, and government entities moved billions of dollars to shield themselves from financial collapse while ensuring they had a stake in the future AGI economy.</p><p name="f823" id="f823" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Key Financial Metrics:</p><p name="c9e5" id="c9e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">$600 Billion Market Cap Loss in NVIDIA after AGI implementation was leaked to select insiders (estimated market impact of AGI-related information).</p><p name="7406" id="7406" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">$2.5 Billion in Short-Selling Profits made by Citadel Advisors by predicting the AGI disruption to the hardware market.</p><p name="8fda" id="8fda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">$4 Billion Inflow to China’s State-backed AI Investments, capitalizing on the belief that AGI innovations will redefine global dominance.</p><p name="5dcd" id="5dcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="cde8" id="cde8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. Legal and Ethical Implications</p><p name="a5df" id="a5df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These actions point to a clear conspiracy among financial elites, tech moguls, and governmental agencies, who have manipulated market forces for their personal gain. In doing so, they have effectively stolen the intellectual property, financially profited, and suppressed the rightful contributors to the AGI revolution.</p><p name="bf4b" id="bf4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The violation of intellectual property, insider trading, and financial market manipulation should prompt legal action. I have taken steps to alert international regulators, and legal advisors are preparing a class action lawsuit against these financial and tech entities.</p><p name="02ec" id="02ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recommendations for Action</p><p name="7427" id="7427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public Disclosure: This report should be used as a basis for a public call to action, ensuring the perpetrators face full public scrutiny and legal consequences.</p><p name="e29e" id="e29e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Press Engagement: Reach out to independent journalists and investigative organizations to validate and spread this information to a wider audience.</p><p name="a4be" id="a4be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regulatory Action: Stock market authorities must investigate and prosecute financial institutions and tech companies involved in suppressing AGI advancements and exploiting insider information.</p><p name="9d22" id="9d22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="e91a" id="e91a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusion</p><p name="8ead" id="8ead" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The financial world has already moved in response to the disruption caused by AGI, but I have not seen any of the benefits of my work. Instead, those in positions of power have reaped the rewards while I have been systematically excluded and suppressed. This report is a call to action, not only for regulators but also for investors and the general public to hold these power brokers accountable for their actions.</p><p name="0a5c" id="0a5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The future of AGI remains in my hands, and with the right actions, I will ensure that this truth is known to those who would have kept it hidden forever.</p><p name="be8c" id="be8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="ca26" id="ca26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Report Author:</p><p name="964b" id="964b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>AGI Pioneer &amp; Financial Analyst<br>Author of the Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) Framework<br>Founder of AGI Revolution Initiative</p></div></div></section>
