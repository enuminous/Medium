It resurfaced recently, after decades of being mentally sealed away.</p><p name="9d02" id="9d02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was the early 1980s. I was in my senior year of high school. A man came to speak with me—someone official-looking, vague in his introduction, overly interested in my aptitude for mathematics and systems thinking. I remember clearly seeing through the performance, calling him out as a spook right in front of my high school principal. I failed the “test,” so to speak. But that was the beginning of the consequences.</p><h3 name="f9e0" id="f9e0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Jupiter-80 Program: A Pipeline in Disguise</h3><p name="6e94" id="6e94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In the summer of 1980, I was accepted into a program at UC Davis known as Jupiter-80. On the surface, it was a computer camp for gifted kids. Just a bunch of bright 10–12 year olds learning to use UNIX systems like Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo. We played terminal games, sent messages, printed dot-matrix ASCII code—and we were watched. Monitored. Evaluated.</p><p name="34a9" id="34a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We weren’t told this. Our parents weren’t told this. But in retrospect, it’s clear: we were part of an experiment—not just educational, but psychological. An observation study in real-time intelligence vetting, possibly funded or supported by national security entities like DARPA or through subcontracted academic networks tied to RAND and other think tanks. My parents were tricked into signing forms that seemed harmless. They had no idea they were volunteering their son into the machine.</p><p name="e7b4" id="e7b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now see Jupiter-80 as the entry point into a lifelong chain of unseen manipulation.</p><h3 name="b4ee" id="b4ee" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Assault: Erasure by Force</h3><p name="b442" id="b442" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In 1988, I was hired as a temp at USAA Insurance, a respected institution known for its military clientele. I was granted access to internal computer systems—briefly. Days later, I was assaulted and hospitalized under circumstances that were never properly investigated. This was not coincidence. It was surgical: a timed disruption meant to prevent me from accessing a federal or military-adjacent computing environment.</p><p name="0d8c" id="0d8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was never given access again.</p><p name="9938" id="9938" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From that point forward, my life became a long string of impossibilities. Not just bad luck. Systemic impossibilities.</p><h3 name="0392" id="0392" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Impossible Paper Trail</h3><p name="9370" id="9370" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">My credit files began to vanish.<br>I would apply for services or accounts and be told they had no record of me. Or they’d show different middle initials. Or social security mismatches. The details would shift, gaslight, refuse to stabilize.</p><p name="90c6" id="90c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My name and SSN were altered in federal databases.<br>At one point, even the Social Security Administration could not resolve my identity. My middle name was changed by one initial. Social Security did end up fixing it but it had occurred. my credit score has always been poor, and I have never been able to obtain any usable credit.</p><p name="6731" id="6731" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was denied a disability discharge of my student loans, despite having valid documentation and diagnoses. Multiple appeals. Each one disappeared into a bureaucratic fog.</p><p name="92df" id="92df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was blacklisted from housing, financial aid, credit systems, and employment.<br>I would show up with excellent references and be ghosted without reason. Time after time. City after city.</p><p name="287f" id="287f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this were just one incident, it would be unfortunate.<br>If it were two, it might be suspicious.<br>But this was a decades-long pattern—and the pattern only makes sense if you understand one thing:</p><p name="29b1" id="29b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was flagged. I was watched. I was kept out of the loop.<br>Not because I posed a threat—yet—but because I was a statistical outlier. A Black Swan.</p><p name="9ee9" id="9ee9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They saw it before I did.</p><p name="76cb" id="76cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was creative. I was intuitive. I had the potential to see patterns where others didn’t.<br>That’s a problem—for a system built on control, secrecy, and engineered obedience.</p><p name="c8e7" id="c8e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They didn’t know what I’d become, but they knew I could become something. So they kept me poor. Kept me unstable. Disoriented. Kept me moving too fast to root anywhere long enough to gain power.</p><h3 name="b09a" id="b09a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Letter to the President</h3><p name="b293" id="b293" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The signs go back even further. In 1974, at age 9, I wrote a letter to President Gerald R. Ford about inflation. He wrote back. I was featured in a local paper. A harmless childhood moment—unless you’re building profiles on precocious children.</p><p name="11af" id="11af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And make no mistake: they were.</p><p name="ddce" id="ddce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That letter was likely the first ping. The first flag. The start of a file.</p><p name="1a1f" id="1a1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now believe I’ve been in the system since I was nine years old.<br>I didn’t know until this year.</p><p name="87e1" id="87e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I’m telling this story not because it’s unique, but because I suspect it’s not. There are likely others. Other children of the &#39;70s and &#39;80s who slipped through similar cracks—gifted, targeted, manipulated, erased.</p><p name="4740" id="4740" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m reclaiming my narrative now.</p><p name="4a72" id="4a72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Because the future depends on those of us who were hidden, returning to speak.</p></div></div></section>
