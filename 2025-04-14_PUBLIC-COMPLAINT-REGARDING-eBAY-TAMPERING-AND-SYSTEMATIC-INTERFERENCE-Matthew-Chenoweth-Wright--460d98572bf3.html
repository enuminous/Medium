Ford Letter to Me, a Child in 1974</p><figure name="3685" id="3685" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WHshTpeV7JznAripfn9XSQ.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WHshTpeV7JznAripfn9XSQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">“The listing is still active, so you can edit them” Really? Where’s mine? It took a while to put that together too, and you would think that all you would let me do is go revise the listing, change a few words, and we re list it. That is what all of your public facing documentation has said to me, eBay. you are in business to help us make money, not make it hard for us to do so, right? I already appealed this, and sent you a letter internally, and yet this has not been fixed. you know I’m disabled, and you know I can’t just pick up the phone and call your company and explain it to somebody.</figcaption></figure><p name="fcb7" id="fcb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is a formal public complaint concerning manipulated suppression, misrepresentation of policy, and nonfunctional remediation pathways imposed by eBay on my attempt to sell a historic item: a 1974 letter from President Gerald R. Ford addressed to me personally, Matthew Chenoweth Wright.</p><figure name="58d6" id="58d6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*fe6-aV0DE5QXcMQNhPIdKA.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fe6-aV0DE5QXcMQNhPIdKA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">This is evidence of a dysfunction in their system that was deliberately created because of the nature of the item. normally, these buttons aren’t disabled, are they?</figcaption></figure><p name="a206" id="a206" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I listed this verified letter with full documentation, provenance, and contextual explanation. I included, as is often accepted in other listings, a link for external verification—a common practice on eBay for collectibles and historical ephemera.</p><p name="b9c1" id="b9c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of a transparent moderation process, I received:</p><p name="8624" id="8624" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A policy violation notice citing “attempts to sell outside of eBay,” despite no such language, coordination, or solicitation in the listing.</p><p name="6c3a" id="6c3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A directive stating I could simply “revise and relist” the item, but when I attempted to do so, I was met with a nonfunctional interface.</p><p name="8a73" id="8a73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The system blocked me from copying or pasting the description, and the entire listing was inaccessible for editing despite eBay claiming otherwise.</p><p name="4c6a" id="4c6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only option remaining was to rebuild the entire listing from scratch, a multi-hour process for a rare, high-value document.</p><p name="7477" id="7477" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The auction was listed at $50,000 with a best offer option. This was a reasonable starting point for a unique presidential letter sent during the WIN campaign era, with documented proof of its historical authenticity.</p><figure name="88fe" id="88fe" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*NVkK5C6hBunDrEWvr9fPWw.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NVkK5C6hBunDrEWvr9fPWw.png"></figure><p name="86a1" id="86a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This takedown was not neutral. It was:</p><p name="f54f" id="f54f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deliberate in its targeting.</p><p name="32fd" id="32fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deceptive in the options it provided.</p><p name="1e31" id="1e31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Destructive in its impact on my right to conduct legitimate business through a platform I had used for years.</p><p name="5d35" id="5d35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The item is now missing from the platform’s search system entirely. The support interface gaslights users into believing resolution is possible, while ensuring the only option is total recreation of a listing that violated no enforceable policy.</p><p name="4daa" id="4daa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have previously published whistleblower disclosures involving PayPal, eBay, Robinhood, and Twitter/X. The Gerald Ford letter listing was among the most visible recent expressions of that history—and the system removed it.</p><p name="2e49" id="2e49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not a matter of community standards—this is interference. This is not an algorithmic glitch—this is a digital barrier put in place to delay, exhaust, and suppress.</p><p name="1873" id="1873" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><figure name="caaa" id="caaa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0RVHQ-or0Mw9ILhgUg-jmQ.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0RVHQ-or0Mw9ILhgUg-jmQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">I did not offer to buy or sell outside ebay, I did not share direct contact information prior to an eBay purchase. These are the direct communications to me, and the only communication about their reason.</figcaption></figure><p name="e8ab" id="e8ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">My Demands:</p><p name="1e62" id="1e62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Full reinstatement of my original listing, with visibility restored and all original metadata preserved.</p><p name="e5f5" id="e5f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. A formal response from eBay compliance staff with a timestamped record of who flagged, reviewed, and shut down the listing.</p><p name="933d" id="933d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Legal acknowledgment that the current procedure for appeal is broken and that eBay’s moderation AI may be used by malicious actors to target and disrupt whistleblower-protected activity.</p><p name="cae2" id="cae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><figure name="d3d2" id="d3d2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*J0rdl1PSEcZxetZL3vqKcA.png" data-width="720" data-height="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J0rdl1PSEcZxetZL3vqKcA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">This is what I got when I clicked on the listing itself, in an attempt to edit it. The listing actually flashes on the screen really quick, and then is replaced with this.</figcaption></figure><p name="caf8" id="caf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is my archive.
