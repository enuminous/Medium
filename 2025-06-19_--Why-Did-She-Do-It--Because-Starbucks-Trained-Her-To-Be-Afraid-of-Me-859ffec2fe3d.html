Because Starbucks Trained Her To Be Afraid of Me</h3><p name="90a8" id="90a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Autistic Physicist, Whistleblower, and American Citizen</p><p name="df9b" id="df9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s not pretend this was just a bad apple.</p><p name="bb4a" id="bb4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What happened to me at the Pioneer Avenue Starbucks in Woodland, California wasn’t some rogue employee going off script.</p><p name="fd0a" id="fd0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a woman following a system.</p><p name="5661" id="5661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that system trained her to fear people like me—disabled, different, neurodivergent.</p><p name="29ab" id="29ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🧠 The Setup</p><p name="aa56" id="aa56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wasn’t disruptive.</p><p name="d81b" id="d81b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wasn’t shouting, threatening, or making a mess.</p><p name="f38e" id="f38e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was sitting quietly with a free cup of water, trying to calm myself before the day began. It was 5:30 in the morning. There were no other customers in the store.</p><p name="58cb" id="58cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am autistic. I’ve been coming to that store for over a year. Everyone knows my name. They know my drink. I’ve spent thousands of dollars at Starbucks.</p><p name="15fa" id="15fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this time, a supervisor—who also knew me by name—decided to make a move. She approached me not with kindness, but with performance:</p><p name="a67a" id="a67a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; “We’re going to start enforcing the policy for you.”</p><p name="2c10" id="2c10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then—she called the police.</p><p name="17f7" id="17f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Three armed Woodland officers showed up to confront me.</p><p name="c039" id="c039" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over water.<br>Over silence.<br>Over being neurodivergent in public.</p><p name="a395" id="a395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">❓ Why Did She Do It?</p><p name="b52a" id="b52a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s easy to say she was cruel. But that’s not the whole truth.<br>She did it because Starbucks has trained its workers to fear difference and prioritize corporate liability over compassion.</p><p name="999b" id="999b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve thought about this again and again. I don’t think she hated me. I think she feared what would happen to her if she didn’t act.</p><p name="f91a" id="f91a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She wasn’t thinking about justice.<br>She wasn’t thinking about dignity.<br>She was thinking about her job.</p><p name="cf35" id="cf35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because when you’re a supervisor at a corporate chain like Starbucks, you are not trained to trust your judgment.<br>You are trained to enforce policy—especially when it comes to people who don’t fit the mold.</p><p name="b0e1" id="b0e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">⚖️ This is How Structural Ableism Works</p><p name="d3ea" id="d3ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She looked at me and didn’t see a regular customer.<br>She saw a liability.</p><p name="ab4f" id="ab4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She saw someone who might “cause something.”<br>Someone who might “draw attention.”<br>Someone whose stillness, poverty, or vulnerability made her job harder to explain to someone above her.</p><p name="8f1d" id="8f1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So she escalated.<br>Not because she had to.<br>But because she was conditioned to believe that not escalating was dangerous—to her.</p><p name="58e3" id="58e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is training failure.</p><p name="174d" id="174d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is institutionalized ableism.</p><p name="8539" id="8539" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is policy over people.</p><p name="ad3a" id="ad3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">💥 The Consequences</p><p name="f967" id="f967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not just another upset customer. I am a disabled person.<br>I have legal rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.<br>And calling the police on a neurodivergent individual having a quiet morning is not only excessive—it’s traumatizing and dangerous.</p><p name="e2fa" id="e2fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could have been arrested.<br>I could have been hurt.<br>I could have <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">died</strong>.</p><p name="3ded" id="3ded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And why? Because a woman feared that letting me be would put her job at risk.</p><p name="ccbc" id="ccbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is what Starbucks trains into its supervisors:<br>If you don’t follow policy rigidly, you’re the next liability.</p><p name="6be9" id="6be9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔁 Starbucks Needs to Retrain Its Entire Model</p><p name="0fa5" id="0fa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s what Starbucks should be training instead:</p><p name="7876" id="7876" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When in doubt, de-escalate with empathy.</p><p name="32f9" id="32f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A person sitting quietly isn’t a threat.</p><p name="f001" id="f001" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Autistic people regulate differently—learn to recognize it.</p><p name="2bbd" id="2bbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Police are not your first step. They are the last resort.</p><p name="2ee2" id="2ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A human moment matters more than a policy script.</p><p name="f35d" id="f35d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this woman felt afraid not of me, but for her own job if she didn’t take action, then the training itself is broken.</p><p name="eba9" id="eba9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🛑 This Ends Now</p><p name="1c62" id="1c62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not about her anymore. This is about how Starbucks trains its staff to react with fear, instead of care.</p><p name="7b33" id="7b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You don’t get to say you’re inclusive while calling the cops on disabled people drinking water at dawn.</p><p name="a712" id="a712" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You don’t get to be “the third place” if your workers are afraid of compassion because your corporate model punishes it.</p><p name="8a7f" id="8a7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks, you need to fix this.</p><p name="2b4c" id="2b4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not just for me—but for every disabled person your policies quietly push out of your spaces every day.</p><p name="acc5" id="acc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist.
