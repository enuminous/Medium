I was regulating. I was seeking a moment of peace.</p><p name="1eaf" id="1eaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, Starbucks called the police on me.</p><p name="aa7d" id="aa7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me say that again: Starbucks called three armed, uniformed police officers to confront a disabled man‚Äîme‚Äîbecause I was sitting quietly with a cup of water.</p><p name="7c25" id="7c25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This happened at the Pioneer Avenue Starbucks in Woodland, California.</p><p name="7e4e" id="7e4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it has left me emotionally shattered.</p><p name="09e3" id="09e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üí• What Actually Happened</p><p name="0e5a" id="0e5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a regular at that store. I‚Äôve spent thousands of dollars at Starbucks over the years. The employees know me by name. They know what I drink.</p><p name="d19f" id="d19f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this week, a supervisor‚Äîwho also knew me by name‚Äîapproached me with an odd air of performative authority. I had just received my usual free cup of water, as I often do in the early mornings when funds are low and my nerves are shot.</p><p name="1660" id="1660" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of letting me sit quietly, she decided it was time to ‚Äústart enforcing policy‚Äù‚Äîspecifically, for me. That‚Äôs what she said. There was no other customer present to witness or be ‚Äúdisturbed.‚Äù There was no problem to solve.</p><p name="a762" id="a762" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But within moments, I found myself outside the store in tears, as three Woodland police officers arrived‚Äîcalled in because I, an autistic man, was quietly trying to exist in public space.</p><p name="0881" id="0881" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üß† The Damage Is Done</p><p name="a7bb" id="a7bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This wasn‚Äôt a misunderstanding. It was harassment, and it was traumatizing. And despite Starbucks‚Äô later apology via email, there is no undoing the terror of seeing police approach you when you‚Äôve done nothing wrong‚Äîespecially when you&#39;re autistic, vulnerable, and already emotionally fragile.</p><p name="545f" id="545f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn&#39;t sleep that night.<br>I haven‚Äôt felt safe since.<br>And the very place that once gave me small comfort‚ÄîStarbucks‚Äîhas now become a site of distress, humiliation, and fear.</p><p name="fb20" id="fb20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be clear: this is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p><p name="bf5c" id="bf5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">‚öñÔ∏è This Is About Civil Rights</p><p name="dc53" id="dc53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under the ADA, I have a legal right to reasonable accommodation and protection from discrimination. That means being able to sit quietly with a cup of water without being treated like a threat.</p><p name="ff20" id="ff20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, Starbucks:</p><p name="7018" id="7018" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Targeted a known disabled customer</p><p name="aecf" id="aecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Escalated a non-incident</p><p name="1dfe" id="1dfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Called armed law enforcement to deal with someone who was calm and in need of peace</p><p name="1690" id="1690" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Caused lasting emotional harm</p><p name="52a2" id="52a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That‚Äôs not customer service. That‚Äôs trauma.</p><p name="735e" id="735e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I refuse to let this go unchallenged.</p><p name="ffe3" id="ffe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üì¢ This Isn‚Äôt Just My Story</p><p name="a0e1" id="a0e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This could‚Äôve happened to any disabled person.<br>To anyone trying to regulate in a public space.<br>To someone who didn‚Äôt have the ability to fight back or tell the story afterward.</p><p name="e153" id="e153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I‚Äôm telling it now because I can.<br>Because I must.<br>Because this cannot be normalized.</p><p name="7cbc" id="7cbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You do not get to weaponize ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù to harm people with disabilities.<br>You do not get to turn a cup of water into a police matter.<br>You do not get to sweep this under the rug with a generic apology and a link to your chat support team.</p><p name="e992" id="e992" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üî• What I Want</p><p name="ae40" id="ae40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. A written response from Starbucks&#39; ADA compliance or legal department.</p><p name="15ed" id="15ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. A full investigation and accountability for the staff who escalated this.</p><p name="4b75" id="4b75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. A public commitment to training your employees in how to treat neurodivergent customers with dignity.</p><p name="a0b9" id="a0b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. A formal acknowledgment of the trauma caused by calling the police on a disabled man for sitting quietly.</p><p name="2456" id="2456" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You want to talk about inclusion? Then include us when it matters.</p><p name="15a3" id="15a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You say Starbucks is a &quot;third place&quot;? Then make sure it‚Äôs a place we can exist in.</p><p name="73dc" id="73dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn‚Äôt ask for conflict.<br>I asked for water.<br>I asked for a moment of calm.</p><p name="9f71" id="9f71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And what I got was confrontation, escalation, and harm.</p><p name="f186" id="f186" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not over.</p><p name="882c" id="882c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist.
