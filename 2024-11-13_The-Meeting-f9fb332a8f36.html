Joe Biden sits behind the Resolute Desk, maintaining a composed and empathetic look. Donald Trump, freshly returned as president-elect, sits across, shifting slightly uncomfortably in his chair.</strong></p><p name="6296" id="6296" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: Well, Donald, here we are again. I didn’t think I’d be seeing you back here like this, to be honest.</p><p name="830c" id="830c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [nods, trying to appear relaxed] Yeah, Joe, you know how it is… they just can’t keep me away. People have been wanting this. They need a real change. A big one.</p><p name="cf19" id="cf19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: Change, huh? [laughs softly, then sighs] Look, the people decided, and I respect that. It’s just… well, I can’t say I haven’t had my concerns. Especially after — well, you know, after what happened last time.</p><p name="d7b0" id="d7b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [shrugs] People don’t care about that stuff. They care about the economy, about not being pushed around by, you know, all these other countries. We got taken advantage of under you, Joe. It’s all they’re talking about.</p><p name="15ea" id="15ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: Sure, they care about the economy, I get it. And we’re in better shape than we were — my administration made gains after COVID. [pauses] But you don’t think it makes a difference to folks, what they saw from you with those indictments?</p><p name="d4bf" id="d4bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [leans back, dismissively] Indictments, convictions — whatever you want to call them — just a bunch of nonsense, Joe. It’s fake news, all of it. Political hit jobs. Everyone knows it. The people that voted for me, they know it’s not real.</p><p name="121e" id="121e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [looks at Trump seriously] You know, I think we’d both agree that we’ve had our share of obstacles, Donald. But sometimes we’ve got to look at things beyond what’s good for us and think about what it’s all doing to the country.</p><p name="11da" id="11da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [with a slight smirk] Oh, believe me, I’m thinking about this country, Joe. Always have been. And I’ve done more for it in four years than most presidents do in eight. It’s why I’m back.</p><p name="2de1" id="2de1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [softly, almost to himself] Maybe so. [pauses, then looks directly at Trump] But I’d ask you to think about how much we can handle. We’re seeing divides like never before. And this office — it needs to mean something, you know? I know we’re not exactly cut from the same cloth, but the institution — it’s supposed to transcend all this mess we’re in.</p><p name="a7d5" id="a7d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [chuckles] Well, I don’t think most people are too interested in “institutions” these days, Joe. They’re interested in change. In feeling like somebody is out there fighting for them — not just saying all the right things, but actually shaking things up.</p><p name="c77d" id="c77d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [nodding slowly] That’s just it, though, Donald. We’ve got folks out there who feel like this place doesn’t even belong to them anymore. They’ve lost a lot of faith in all of us. And when they’re pushed too hard, or given too many reasons to doubt the system — we end up in places we might not come back from.</p><p name="c0df" id="c0df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [scoffs] Oh, the media loves to say that. “Democracy’s at stake,” “we’re never coming back.” They’re just words. We’ve got the strongest country in the world, Joe. Strongest economy, strongest military — you don’t think we’ll survive a little heat in politics?</p><p name="1798" id="1798" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [leaning forward] That’s where you’re wrong, I think. We’re only strong as long as we believe in what we’re doing here. You can build walls, tariffs, armies — but if the folks who put us in these seats don’t believe in the process… well, you know as well as I do, this place runs on trust.</p><p name="b7bf" id="b7bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [waves a hand] Yeah, yeah, but trust goes both ways, Joe. We’ve got people trusting us to not sell them out, to protect their jobs. That’s what I’m doing. And by the way, not everyone’s buying into this whole “let’s all hold hands and sing” thing. You know that.</p><p name="28d6" id="28d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [pauses, choosing his words] Well, you’ll have your chance now to try your way again. I just hope you remember that you’re leading everyone, not just the folks who cheer you on. [pauses, softer] This job… well, it has a way of reminding us of that.</p><p name="e775" id="e775" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [smirking slightly] I think I’ll be just fine, Joe. I know what I came here to do, and I’ll be doing it, loud and clear. This country wants strength. And they’re gonna get it.</p><p name="589a" id="589a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [smiles sadly] I guess they’ll get what they’ve asked for. Just… I hope we don’t lose more than we’re all prepared to give.</p><figure name="f779" id="f779" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*AZlw7UnkZz5n7oVu3GYc_Q.png" data-width="1312" data-height="736" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AZlw7UnkZz5n7oVu3GYc_Q.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Even A Few AI Wouldn’t Generate These Fake Photos For Reasons Known Only To Their Shareholders.</figcaption></figure><p name="7dc9" id="7dc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">They both fall silent, the tension thick between them, knowing the challenges ahead — for each other, and for the country they’ve both been chosen to lead.</strong></p><p name="0f40" id="0f40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: Look, Donald, before we go any further, I need to say this. We can’t pretend we’re starting with a clean slate here. People are worried. And for good reason. There’s still the memory of everything that happened after 2020 — January 6, that “Stop the Steal” rally, the pressure on people to overturn the election. [pauses, watching Trump’s reaction] You pushed some dangerous things, Donald. And I don’t think you’ve ever really addressed it.</p><p name="9c33" id="9c33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [visibly annoyed, sits up straighter] Joe, that was the will of the people. They knew something was wrong — everyone did. They just wanted a fair election, and they got… well, let’s say they got something else entirely.</p><p name="5ccf" id="5ccf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [leaning in, firm] You mean they got the truth. And a legal outcome that showed, over and over, that nothing was rigged. But instead of backing off, you doubled down on that “Big Lie.” You know how many court cases you lost over that? What was it… 60 or so? And you kept at it, sowing doubt, stirring up anger.</p><p name="7eaf" id="7eaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [starting to bluster] People needed to know that their voices were heard! You think I was gonna just sit back while they felt cheated? They wanted answers, and that’s what I gave them.</p><p name="e7d1" id="e7d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [shaking his head] And what about the consequences, Donald? What about the Capitol police who were attacked, the staffers hiding for their lives, members of Congress barricading doors? [pauses] You still haven’t taken responsibility for any of it. You pushed and pushed, and that day got out of control — because you kept feeding them those lies.</p><p name="4b5f" id="4b5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [getting defensive] Lies? They’re not lies if people believe them, Joe! There was something wrong with that election, and a lot of people saw it.</p><figure name="e173" id="e173" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lVQ0i6XPNuWvD7pYBXEONg.png" data-width="1312" data-height="736" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lVQ0i6XPNuWvD7pYBXEONg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">That’s Not How It Works. That’s Not How Any Of This Works.</figcaption></figure><p name="342c" id="342c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [firmly] No, Donald, that’s not how it works. The truth doesn’t change because you want it to. You pushed it so far that even your own advisers — those counter-intelligence officials — were looking into what you were up to. We’re talking about national security here. You remember Flynn, Bannon, that whole mess with Russia?</p><p name="6e5e" id="6e5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [becoming visibly agitated, waving a hand dismissively] Oh, don’t start with that “Russia, Russia, Russia” nonsense again. There was no collusion. They looked into it, and what did they find? Nothing.</p><p name="5ebf" id="5ebf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [deadpan] They found a lot more than nothing, Donald. That’s why Mueller’s team came back with all those indictments. [pauses] You had Flynn practically dealing on the side with foreign governments. Bannon pocketing money with that fake border wall fund. And the rest of those grifters — tell me, Donald, did you ever once put a stop to any of it?</p><p name="fc74" id="fc74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [smirking, though visibly shaken] I can’t control everyone, Joe. People are going to do what they want. And by the way, let’s not act like all of Washington’s squeaky clean. You’ve had your share of dirty players too, don’t forget that.</p><p name="22bb" id="22bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [sighs, more exasperated now] You’re missing the point, Donald. You’ve got a responsibility in this office to protect the integrity of the country, not let people make a mockery of it. You had the head of your own intelligence community warning about Russia’s interference, and what did you do? You denied it. Let Putin walk all over us. You remember that press conference in Helsinki? The whole country saw it.</p><p name="37c7" id="37c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [slams his hand on the arm of the chair] I was trying to keep things calm! Build relationships. Diplomacy, Joe, something your people never understood.</p><p name="5c39" id="5c39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [sternly] Diplomacy doesn’t mean selling out our intelligence, our institutions. You had people wondering if you’d lost track of who you were even working for, Donald. And it wasn’t just Helsinki. Your entire administration was peppered with investigations and scandals, your company facing court findings for fraudulent practices in New York. [pauses, gauging Trump’s reaction] I’m talking about judges, Donald, not “fake news.” Judges, juries, evidence. It’s all public record now.</p><p name="898b" id="898b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [stammering, visibly defensive] That’s… that’s all political. They’ve been out to get me since day one. It’s a witch hunt. You know that. Look at what they tried to pull in Georgia — trying to stop people from voting for me!</p><p name="ba7f" id="ba7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [shakes his head] And that’s exactly what I mean. Your “witch hunt” excuse… [leans forward] You don’t think I know what it’s like to be in the hot seat? But there’s a line, Donald. A line you crossed, over and over. It’s not just about you and me, or left versus right. This is about decency, about the law.</p><p name="49db" id="49db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [blustering] Oh, sure, “the law” that’s out to make an example of me. Just wait until I’m back in office, Joe. This country needs strong leadership, someone who doesn’t bow down every time the media gets their hands on some “scandal.”</p><p name="97d1" id="97d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [sighs, softer but resolute] It needs accountability, Donald. You can try to dodge it, but people are watching. And they know. You’ve been convicted for fraud, faced sexual assault accusations — found liable for it, no less. And instead of owning up, you’re doubling down, running on bluster.</p><p name="7151" id="7151" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [leans forward, seething] And maybe that’s exactly what this country needs. Someone who doesn’t play by all your rules, Joe. The people who elected me, they’re tired of you and your kind, the bureaucrats who tell everyone else how to live while you get rich off their backs.</p><p name="8947" id="8947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [maintaining composure] I’ve dedicated my life to service, Donald. And I may not have always been perfect, but I can look at myself in the mirror every morning knowing I tried to keep this country together. To protect it, even when I had to work with people I disagreed with. [pauses] But you… you just keep tearing at the seams.</p><p name="6018" id="6018" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [pauses, clearly frustrated, but attempting to sound firm] And I’m going to keep doing what I came here to do. If that means shaking things up, so be it.</p><p name="dac5" id="dac5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [sighing heavily] Well, I hope — for all our sakes — that this time, you figure out what it really means to lead… So, tell me this, Donald — did any of this feel like “leadership” to you? You pressured state officials to “find votes” after the election. Do you know how that looks? The most powerful man in the country calling up secretaries of state, asking them to find votes that just weren’t there?</p><p name="6cd0" id="6cd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [defensive] I was just looking for fairness, Joe. When you see something that doesn’t add up, you’re supposed to speak up. That’s what I did. They wouldn’t listen to me otherwise.</p><p name="a78f" id="a78f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [firm] There’s a difference between looking for fairness and trying to strong-arm officials into changing results. And we both know that. But you’ve never respected those boundaries, have you? It was the same pattern when it came to the Trump Organization, taking from the very people who trusted you. That’s why you ended up in court — and lost, Donald. They’ve got the evidence, the records, the witnesses.</p><p name="5936" id="5936" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [waving a hand dismissively] All trumped-up nonsense. Those judges are all the same — biased, looking for any excuse to come down on me. They were handpicked to hurt me.</p><p name="16e9" id="16e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [leaning in] And the people who worked with you, Donald? Your CFO who testified in court? The paper trails? I think we both know there’s only so much you can hide behind “biased judges.” You don’t think it adds up that all these people around you were caught in schemes, convicted, and yet it’s everyone else who’s the problem?</p><p name="bc2d" id="bc2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [smirking, though visibly irritated] I didn’t tell anyone to do anything. People do what they do. That’s business, Joe. It’s rough. You wouldn’t understand.</p><p name="19a2" id="19a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [sarcastic] Right. Just “business as usual.” So it was just “business” when Flynn was talking with foreign powers, or when Bannon was pocketing millions from “fundraisers.” All on your watch. These aren’t just misunderstandings, Donald — these are people breaking the law, over and over, and you look the other way, or worse, encourage it.</p><p name="5274" id="5274" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [growing defensive] Those are patriots, Joe. They’re fighters, like me. I don’t abandon people who’ve been loyal to me, who’ve stood by me when everyone else turned against us. Maybe that’s why people are so afraid of me getting back in here.</p><p name="287b" id="287b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [sighs] You still don’t get it. It’s not about loyalty to you, Donald. It’s about loyalty to the office, to the country. Not to “yes-men” who run side hustles under the banner of patriotism. And the country saw it, Donald. They saw the insider dealings, the lies, the corruption — plain as day.</p><p name="e7f3" id="e7f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [exasperated] And what about your son, Joe? The media just lets you slide right by, doesn’t it?</p><p name="cce6" id="cce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [unfazed] We’re talking about you, Donald. And that’s not going to distract from the fact that you’ve got a pattern of skirting the law, even defying it, while brushing aside the consequences. [pauses, letting that sink in] But one day, Donald, there’s a reckoning. You can dodge court cases, push through legal loopholes, tell yourself you’re fighting for the people — but eventually, everyone’s got to answer for their actions.</p><p name="2a45" id="2a45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [bristling, deflecting] You know, you can act all high and mighty, Joe, but the American people want someone who’ll fight back. Not play by the same rules that failed them for years.</p><p name="28ef" id="28ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [steadily] Fighting back isn’t the same as tearing down. And all those people you claim to be fighting for — if they knew the half of it… [pauses, shaking his head] Well, maybe they’ll find out. Because in this office, there are no shortcuts, Donald. Everything eventually comes to light. You know, Donald, this office — it has a way of revealing who people really are. Over the years, I’ve watched men try to outsmart it, outflank it, thinking they could use it for their own gain. They end up breaking themselves against it. Because this place demands accountability, no matter how much you try to dodge it.</p><p name="7ce0" id="7ce0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [scoffs, trying to regain confidence] Accountability? Joe, that’s rich coming from you. You and your whole system are the reason people wanted me back. They’re tired of the elites telling them how to live while you all sit back, counting your money.</p><p name="0159" id="0159" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [raising an eyebrow, unshaken] Elites, huh? I’ll tell you what I know about the people. I spent years in train stations, shaking hands, listening to their stories, knowing their struggles firsthand. What I didn’t do was make promises I couldn’t keep or stoke fears I knew were baseless. I didn’t look them in the eyes and lie to line my own pockets. [pauses, letting his words settle] But you… you used them, Donald. And it’s catching up with you, faster than you might want to admit.</p><p name="9ae8" id="9ae8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [trying to deflect, but visibly rattled] People wanted someone who’d cut through the garbage, Joe. Someone who didn’t care about the “right way” of doing things, because that “right way” never did a damn thing for them.</p><p name="39ef" id="39ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [leaning forward, his tone sharper] There’s a difference between fighting for change and leaving wreckage in your wake, Donald. It’s one thing to shake things up, but what you’ve done — it’s scorched earth. The election lies, January 6, trying to overturn states’ votes — [pauses, voice softening with disappointment] You weren’t fighting for the people; you were fighting for yourself.</p><p name="24f0" id="24f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [defensive] Oh, like you’ve never made a decision with yourself in mind, Joe? Give me a break.</p><p name="0650" id="0650" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [nods thoughtfully] Sure, I’ve made mistakes. But here’s the difference — I learn from them, I own up to them. I don’t brush it off, I don’t call it a “witch hunt.” [pauses, tone hardening] And I sure as hell don’t throw the rulebook out the window just because it doesn’t suit me. That’s not leadership, Donald. That’s tyranny.</p><p name="9647" id="9647" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [sputtering] Tyranny? Tyranny is what your people have been doing to me since day one. The investigations, the FBI raids — nobody else would have put up with that.</p><p name="c37f" id="c37f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [cutting in] No one else would’ve brought it on themselves the way you did, Donald. You didn’t just push boundaries — you broke them, over and over. From the Trump Tower meeting with Russians to the schemes to use presidential power to silence people who’d expose you… [pauses] The truth is, you weren’t looking out for this country. You were using it, seeing how much you could get away with before someone stopped you.</p><p name="51ef" id="51ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [defiant] And maybe that’s what this country needs! You play by the old rules, and look where it’s gotten us. People wanted someone to bulldoze through all the red tape, to get things done.</p><p name="09ad" id="09ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [voice firm and measured] But getting things done doesn’t mean breaking the law. It doesn’t mean tearing down the system until there’s nothing left. You left a trail of broken promises, of deceit. [leans forward, voice a notch softer but piercing] And all those people you say you’re fighting for — what do you think happens to them if everything falls apart because you couldn’t respect the rules?</p><p name="5e43" id="5e43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [growing visibly agitated] I didn’t come here to keep everything “nice and tidy,” Joe. I came here to shake things up, to make things work for the people who’ve been forgotten. That’s what my supporters know — they know I’m fighting for them, not for some “tradition.”</p><p name="a5e3" id="a5e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [sighing, almost pitying] I think they deserve more than that, Donald. They deserve honesty. Respect. Accountability. Things that build a foundation, not tear it down. [pauses, locking eyes with Trump] And they deserve a leader who respects the gravity of this office. Not someone who thinks it’s his own personal sandbox to play king.</p><p name="b4f4" id="b4f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [blustering] I don’t care about your speeches, Joe. I came here to win, to make this country strong again. And you — [pauses, fumbling] you can’t even understand that.</p><p name="0ddc" id="0ddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [steely resolve] I understand this job more than you ever will. And it’s not about winning, Donald. It’s about serving. It’s about putting the country above yourself, above any notion of “winning.” [pauses, leans forward one last time] And I can only hope you’ll see that before it’s too late. Because one way or another, this office will hold you accountable. If not now, then in the history books — and trust me, they won’t be kind.</p><p name="18f6" id="18f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump, visibly rattled, clenches his fists, the bluster dropping momentarily as he seems to wrestle with his emotions. The veneer of confidence begins to crack, and he speaks, almost confessing.</strong></p><figure name="1555" id="1555" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2o001rxCIhM5HmYVv8Slbw.png" data-width="1312" data-height="736" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2o001rxCIhM5HmYVv8Slbw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Point Out To Me On The Doll Where America Hurt You, Donald?</figcaption></figure><p name="3e04" id="3e04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [lowers his voice, almost as if speaking to himself] You don’t get it, Joe. [pauses, his gaze shifting away] This whole thing — it was never fair. From the moment I stepped into this, they were out to get me. The press, the politicians, the so-called experts… all of them. They wanted me gone because I wasn’t one of them.</p><p name="f9ce" id="f9ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [watching intently, letting Trump continue] You didn’t make it easy for them to see you as anything else, Donald. But go on.</p><p name="7520" id="7520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [leans forward, eyes narrow] I had to fight back. Every single day, I had to fight. They were always saying I’d lose, that I’d screw it up. So yeah, maybe I did things my own way, maybe I didn’t “play by the rules.” But look at what they did to me! Investigations, scandals, lies… they couldn’t stand that I was there, breaking their little club wide open.</p><p name="5f67" id="5f67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [measured] I get that Washington can be a tough place, Donald. But you chose this. You wanted this job. And you knew the cost.</p><p name="0fd9" id="0fd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [pauses, visibly struggling] Maybe I did. But I couldn’t just let them push me around, make me look weak. You don’t know what it’s like, Joe, to have everyone out to take you down. To have every word you say, every little thing you do twisted, mocked.</p><p name="5824" id="5824" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [softly] I do, Donald. I’ve been through my share of battles. But that’s the job — you’re supposed to rise above it, not sink deeper into it.</p><p name="4d00" id="4d00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [looking down, voice thick with frustration] Rise above it? I tried. But nothing was ever enough for them. So yeah, I fought back. Maybe I cut some corners, maybe I did what I had to do. But it was the only way to survive. The only way to keep going.</p><p name="9f7b" id="9f7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [gentle but firm] And what did that leave you with? A trail of broken laws, broken promises. People you used up and tossed aside. Did it ever cross your mind that maybe, just maybe, there was a better way?</p><p name="76c1" id="76c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [sighs, looking almost weary] I don’t know, Joe. Maybe there was. But that’s not who I am. I’m not some politician who smiles and shakes hands and says the right things. I win. I fight. That’s what they wanted when they put me here, whether you like it or not.</p><p name="a126" id="a126" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [pauses, letting Trump’s words settle] Maybe that’s true. But if that’s all you are, then maybe this job isn’t for you, Donald. Because leading isn’t just about fighting. It’s about knowing when to stand down, when to listen, when to put your own ego aside for the greater good.</p><p name="3eab" id="3eab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [a flicker of vulnerability] Maybe… maybe I just wanted to prove them wrong. Prove to everyone that I could do this, that I deserved this, even if they hated me for it.</p><p name="1b52" id="1b52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [softly, almost kindly] And maybe that’s the real problem, Donald. You wanted to win more than you wanted to lead. And that’s what’s tearing this country apart.</p><p name="8cd7" id="8cd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump sits back, momentarily silent, wrestling with Biden’s words. The weight of his actions hangs in the air between them, an unspoken acknowledgment of the divide he’s created — not just between them, but within the very fabric of the nation. And in that moment, it’s clear, perhaps even to Trump himself, that there are no easy answers, no simple victories. Only the reality of the choices he’s made. Trump shifts in his chair, his gaze distant, as if looking past Biden, seeing something only he can understand. The bluster and bravado have faded, leaving behind a man wrestling with the truth he has long avoided.</strong></p><p name="ac20" id="ac20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [voice softer, almost vulnerable] You don’t think I wanted to lead? [pauses] Maybe I didn’t know how, Joe. Maybe I just… I didn’t trust anyone enough to let them guide me. Everyone always seemed out for themselves. I thought I was the only one who really knew what was best.</p><p name="a26a" id="a26a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [leaning forward, empathetic but firm] That’s the problem, Donald. Leading isn’t about being the only one who “knows best.” It’s about bringing people together, listening, finding the common ground, even with those who disagree. It’s not about pushing everyone else out so you can stand alone.</p><p name="1107" id="1107" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [grimacing] I didn’t have that luxury. I couldn’t let anyone see weakness. They would’ve taken me down. [pauses, then, voice thick] And maybe, just maybe, I started believing my own stories, thinking I was the only one who could fix it all. I told people what they wanted to hear because… because I wanted them to see me as strong, as invincible.</p><p name="3e39" id="3e39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [nods, compassionate] I get that. We all want to feel strong. But real strength doesn’t come from making others fear you or forcing them to follow you. Real strength comes from being able to admit when you’re wrong, from knowing that you don’t have to have all the answers alone.</p><p name="7d60" id="7d60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [sighing heavily] I don’t know if I can do that. [a pause, eyes flickering with a hint of honesty] This whole time, I kept thinking if I could just win, if I could just keep pushing, it would prove something. Prove that I was right, that everyone who doubted me was wrong.</p><p name="5534" id="5534" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: And maybe it did, to some people. But there’s a cost, Donald. And that cost isn’t just the people who stood by you, who trusted you — it’s the country itself. You kept doubling down, kept tearing down anyone who questioned you. You’ve built walls of division, and now those walls are all that’s left.</p><p name="4fa9" id="4fa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [bitterly] And they’re all against me now. Even the ones who used to cheer me on, some of them have turned their backs. [laughs mirthlessly] I made enemies on both sides.</p><p name="cf15" id="cf15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: That’s what happens when you treat everyone like a threat, Donald. People may follow out of fear, but they don’t stay loyal forever. The moment you stopped serving them and started serving yourself, you lost them. And deep down, you know that.</p><p name="c590" id="c590" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [pausing, visibly pained] And if I did? What now? You think I can just… change, start all over? It doesn’t work like that.</p><p name="aa6c" id="aa6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [softly, almost fatherly] No, maybe it doesn’t. But it’s never too late to try. To make amends, to show people that you can be better than what they’ve seen. That takes courage, Donald. A different kind of courage than you’re used to.</p><p name="6287" id="6287" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [staring down at his hands, almost whispering] And what if they never forgive me? What if everything I did — all those mistakes, all those decisions — what if that’s all they remember?</p><p name="327a" id="327a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [gently] Then you accept it. You own it. You face it head-on. That’s the only way forward. History will remember you, Donald, one way or another. You can’t rewrite what’s done, but you can decide what kind of person you want to be remembered as.</p><p name="8337" id="8337" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">There’s a long silence as Trump sits, shoulders hunched, the weight of the conversation settling heavily on him. For the first time, he seems truly alone — not with Biden, not with his base, not with his loyalists. Just a man reckoning with his legacy.</strong></p><p name="9071" id="9071" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trump</strong>: [quietly, as if to himself] Maybe… maybe I never really knew what I wanted. I thought I did, but… [trails off, lost in thought]</p><p name="e0b7" id="e0b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden</strong>: [standing, his tone soft yet resolute] I hope you find it, Donald. For your own sake, and for the country’s. You have a chance now — a chance to show a different side, to make a different kind of impact. But that decision is yours. No one else can make it for you.</p><p name="da16" id="da16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Biden walks to the door, pausing briefly before leaving. Trump remains seated, staring into the distance, left alone with the echoes of a conversation that has shaken him more than he’d ever let anyone see.
