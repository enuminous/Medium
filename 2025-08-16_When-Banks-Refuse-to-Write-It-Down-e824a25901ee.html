How Financial Institutions Evade Their Legal Duties

There are laws that bind them:</p><p name="89f1" id="89f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA): If a customer expresses intent to apply for credit — even verbally — the bank must treat it as an application, record it, and evaluate it. “No paperwork, no record” is not an excuse.</p><p name="f563" id="f563" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): Banks must provide reasonable accommodations for disabled customers. That can mean flexibility in application formats, direct access to a decision-maker, or assistance in navigating the process. Denying those accommodations is discrimination.</p><p name="2b28" id="2b28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bank Secrecy Act (BSA): When a customer reports suspected financial misconduct or abuse, banks are obligated to escalate, review, and, if appropriate, file a report. Ignoring credible allegations is not optional.<br>These are not “nice to haves.” They are statutory requirements.</p><h3 name="e9e3" id="e9e3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How the Game Is Played</h3><p name="9a32" id="9a32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here’s how the evasion works in practice:</p><p name="433e" id="433e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. You walk in and ask for financing.<br>2. Instead of giving you an application, staff deflect: “You need collateral.”<br>3. You explain your collateral — whether property, intellectual property, or other assets.<br>4. They still don’t give you paperwork.<br>5. Months later, corporate comes back with the perfect circular response: “We have no record of an application.”</p><p name="6655" id="6655" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s not an accident. That’s how banks create a closed loop: refuse to record the application, then deny that it ever happened.</p><h3 name="0994" id="0994" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why This Is Illegal</h3><p name="8395" id="8395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A verbal request for credit is an application under ECOA.</p><p name="d486" id="d486" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A customer disclosing disability is entitled to ADA accommodations.</p><p name="6f59" id="6f59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A credible report of misconduct triggers review under the BSA.<br>Failure to act on these duties is not just “bad customer service.” It is unlawful discrimination, a breach of fiduciary responsibility, and a systemic denial of access to the financial system.</p><h3 name="d167" id="d167" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Human Consequences</h3><p name="19ed" id="19ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This isn’t just paperwork. This is life and death.</p><p name="5bf3" id="5bf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When a person is denied even the chance to apply for financing — when months of requests vanish into the void — the result is economic exclusion. Bills go unpaid. Evictions happen. Food insecurity follows. This is how people are starved out of existence, quietly, under color of banking procedure.</p><p name="71d2" id="71d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And here is the bitter truth: this isn’t one bank, one branch, one bad day. When the same pattern shows up at multiple institutions, the conclusion is unavoidable: this is systemic.</p><h3 name="30eb" id="30eb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why This Matters for Everyone</h3><p name="b311" id="b311" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If it can happen to me — a physicist, a published author, someone who brought printed documentation, URLs, proof of work, and even personal discussions of collateral — it can happen to anyone.</p><p name="0b7a" id="0b7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If banks can pretend your application never existed, then the entire regulatory framework designed to guarantee fair access to credit is meaningless.</p><h3 name="0949" id="0949" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Needs to Change</h3><p name="b699" id="b699" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">1. Enforcement: Regulators must actually hold banks accountable for refusing to record applications and ignoring ADA obligations.<br>2. Transparency: Banks should be required to log every request for credit, whether verbal or written, and provide the customer with a reference number.<br>3. Accountability: Customers who are harmed by “non-recording” tactics should have direct recourse, including damages for economic exclusion.</p><h3 name="e0ad" id="e0ad" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Closing</h3><p name="2b8d" id="2b8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This isn’t about one person or one complaint. This is about whether the financial system operates under the law — or above it.</p><p name="4dda" id="4dda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If banks can refuse to even hand you the paper, if they can make your application disappear with a shrug, then no one is safe.</p><p name="4080" id="4080" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We either have a financial system bound by duty, or we have an arbitrary regime where access depends on who you are, what you’ve published, or who you’ve angered.</p><p name="0cd3" id="0cd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I know which one I’m living in right now. The question is: will the rest of us demand better?</p></div></div></section>
