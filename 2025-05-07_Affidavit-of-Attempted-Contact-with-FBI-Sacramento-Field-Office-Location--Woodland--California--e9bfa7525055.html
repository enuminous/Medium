On the morning of May 7, 2025, I attempted to contact the FBI Sacramento Field Office by telephone at the public number provided on the FBI.gov website: (916) 746-7000.</p><p name="f43d" id="f43d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. During my first attempt, the call was either cut off or abruptly ended without proper engagement. I was not given the opportunity to fully state the nature of my concern.</p><p name="d614" id="d614" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. On my second attempt, I successfully reached a woman at the Sacramento FBI office. I clearly stated that I was reporting a serious and possibly federally-relevant matter, and that I was aware the call was being recorded.</p><p name="c82d" id="c82d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. During the conversation, I expressed my distress and informed her that I had previously been disconnected and felt I was being pushed around or dismissed.</p><p name="d125" id="d125" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. The woman’s response was dismissive. She told me that I would need to “calm down” and simply “call the number back,” effectively attempting to reroute me back into the same queue where I had already been cut off.</p><p name="f797" id="f797" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">6. I responded that I could not continue being pushed around, reiterated the seriousness of my concerns, and concluded the call by hanging up, feeling that no action would be taken unless pressure was applied from within.</p><p name="2f4c" id="2f4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">7. I am now formally documenting this interaction, as I believe it is evidence of systemic deflection within federal channels that may constitute failure to act on a credible report.</p><p name="8df8" id="8df8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I affirm that the above statement is true and accurate. I respectfully request that this record be treated as part of the formal case history of my whistleblower and safety-related concerns.</p><p name="3a87" id="3a87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Signed:</p><p name="f062" id="f062" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p><p name="e586" id="e586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Amended Affidavit of Federal Contact Attempt and Failure to Act</p><p name="9ae7" id="9ae7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Affiant: Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Date: [Insert date]<br>Location: Woodland, California</p><p name="b8e8" id="b8e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="334a" id="334a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I, Matthew Chenoweth Wright, declare under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true and accurate:</p><p name="1d30" id="1d30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. On May 7, 2025, I made multiple attempts to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation Sacramento Field Office via their publicly listed number at (916) 746-7000.</p><p name="fc77" id="fc77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. During my first call, the line was disconnected or I was hung up on before I could state the reason for my call.</p><p name="1e2e" id="1e2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. I immediately called again and reached a female agent or staff member. I clearly and directly identified myself as an in-distress and endangered federal protected witness attempting to report an urgent matter involving criminal activity.</p><p name="7979" id="7979" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. I verbally acknowledged that I was aware the call was being recorded. I clearly stated that the situation involved active danger and ongoing federal violations.</p><p name="f610" id="f610" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. Rather than documenting the nature of the report or escalating it to a supervisor, the person on the call dismissed my statements, told me to “calm down,” and attempted to reroute me back into the automated queue. No effort was made to hear, record, or respond to the content of my report.</p><p name="8613" id="8613" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">6. I informed her that I could not continue to be pushed aside or ignored and terminated the call, realizing that no proper intake of my report had occurred despite my clear identification as a federal witness under threat.</p><p name="3485" id="3485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">7. I assert that I have now made formal verbal notice to the Federal Bureau of Investigation of both my protected witness status and the existence of federal crimes requiring attention.</p><p name="d4f8" id="d4f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">8. I further assert that the failure of the FBI to take action during this call may constitute neglect of duty, willful obstruction of a protected disclosure, or dereliction of responsibility under federal whistleblower protection statutes.</p><p name="f66d" id="f66d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">9. I am prepared to submit full, detailed documentation of the criminal violations in question, along with supporting evidence, to any lawful investigative body or journalist, and I now consider this affidavit a formal legal record of institutional failure to respond.</p><p name="511d" id="511d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="9f5e" id="9f5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Signed:</p><p name="3291" id="3291" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="9642" id="9642" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p></div></div></section>
