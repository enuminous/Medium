How do we tell our children?</figcaption></figure><h4 name="abdc" id="abdc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Introduction: Facing a Difficult Reality</h4><p name="f2c9" id="f2c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As parents, one of the hardest challenges is explaining to our children that sometimes the world isn’t fair. When policies directly affect their friends, neighbors, or community, these conversations become even more urgent. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in schools, hospitals, and churches — places once considered safe havens — represent a profound and troubling shift in American life.</p><p name="2a9c" id="2a9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under President Donald Trump’s administration, policies permitting such raids have been reinstated and expanded, sparking fear and uncertainty in immigrant communities. Talking to children about these realities requires honesty, compassion, and a focus on resilience.</p><h4 name="47fd" id="47fd" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What’s Happening and Why It Matters</h4><p name="402f" id="402f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In 2025, President Trump resumed office and followed through on earlier statements from 2019 to expand ICE operations into “sensitive locations.” Historically, schools, hospitals, and churches were designated as off-limits to immigration enforcement unless extraordinary circumstances justified action. This change has allowed ICE agents to conduct raids in these places without requiring higher-level approval.</p><p name="cc6f" id="cc6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This policy targets undocumented immigrants, whom the administration labels “illegal.” For children, the consequences of these actions are deeply personal — they may witness classmates, neighbors, or even their own family members being taken away. This creates an atmosphere of fear and confusion, raising questions about safety, fairness, and justice.</p><h4 name="6f62" id="6f62" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Explaining to Children: Age-Appropriate Approaches</h4><p name="75ad" id="75ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Conversations about ICE raids must be tailored to a child’s developmental stage, balancing honesty with emotional sensitivity.</p><p name="9431" id="9431" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1. Young Children (Ages 5–8): Reassurance Through Simplicity</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="cc0a" id="cc0a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Use simple language: “Some families don’t have the right papers to live here, and some rules let people come and take them away, even from schools or churches. That’s not how things are supposed to be.”</li><li name="5efa" id="5efa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reassure: “Your teachers and I are here to keep you safe, and we’re always looking out for you.”</li></ul><p name="4289" id="4289" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Older Children (Ages 9–12): Balancing Facts and Empathy</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="2ce5" id="2ce5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Share basic facts: “The President has decided to let workers take people away from places like schools or hospitals if they don’t have the right documents. Many people think this is unfair, and it’s making a lot of families scared.”</li><li name="c829" id="c829" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Encourage empathy: “Imagine how hard it must feel for someone to lose their family or leave their school. How do you think we can support kids who are going through that?”</li></ul><p name="521a" id="521a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3. Teens (Ages 13+): Encouraging Critical Thinking and Advocacy</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="4c1f" id="4c1f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Provide context: “This policy is part of the government’s way of enforcing immigration laws, but it’s upsetting because it’s happening in places that are supposed to be safe for everyone, like schools and churches.”</li><li name="ea01" id="ea01" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Empower action: “You can make a difference by speaking up, supporting organizations that help immigrant families, or learning more about why these policies exist and how to change them.”</li></ul><h4 name="d683" id="d683" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Teaching Empathy and Moral Clarity</h4><p name="92c9" id="92c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">These conversations offer an opportunity to teach children the values of fairness, kindness, and advocacy. Here are some ways to reinforce these lessons:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="13d0" id="13d0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Encourage Questions</strong>: Create a safe space for children to ask about what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what can be done.</li><li name="9ce7" id="9ce7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Model Compassionate Behavior</strong>: Show children how to be supportive friends and allies to those affected. This could include standing up for classmates or being part of community efforts to help.</li><li name="97cb" id="97cb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Share Stories</strong>: Use books, films, or real-life examples to help children understand the experiences of immigrant families.</li></ul><h4 name="1b3e" id="1b3e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Providing Context: This Is Not Normal</h4><p name="1a70" id="1a70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Children should understand that what is happening now is not how things are supposed to work. Explain that:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9849" id="9849" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Checks and Balances Are Meant to Protect People</strong>: “In America, we have a system that’s supposed to stop unfair decisions, but sometimes it takes time for that system to work.”</li><li name="d7e8" id="d7e8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Safe Spaces Are Being Violated</strong>: “Schools, hospitals, and churches have always been places where people didn’t have to be scared. Changing that is unusual and upsetting for many people.”</li><li name="2ecf" id="2ecf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Change Is Possible</strong>: “When people see something wrong, they can work together to make it better. That’s how things have changed in the past, and it can happen again.”</li></ol><h4 name="9b2e" id="9b2e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Empowering Children to Respond</h4><p name="1309" id="1309" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Children often feel powerless in the face of distressing news. Help them see that they can make a difference:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2e36" id="2e36" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Small Acts of Kindness</strong>: Encourage them to be kind and inclusive toward friends or classmates who may feel scared or alone.</li><li name="35bb" id="35bb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Community Engagement</strong>: Participate in activities that support immigrant families, such as food drives, fundraisers, or rallies.</li><li name="3324" id="3324" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Advocacy</strong>: For teens, encourage writing letters to elected officials, joining youth-led organizations, or educating others about the issue.</li></ul><h4 name="f3ae" id="f3ae" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Addressing Fear and Anxiety</h4><p name="be4d" id="be4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Children may feel scared or uncertain about these policies. Reassure them by emphasizing:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="24d4" id="24d4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Their Own Safety</strong>: “Your school and teachers are here to protect you, and we’ll always make sure you’re safe.”</li><li name="0742" id="0742" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Community Support</strong>: “Many people, including teachers, doctors, and religious leaders, are working hard to stand up for families and make things better.”</li></ul><h4 name="6657" id="6657" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Conclusion: Building a More Just Future</h4><p name="084c" id="084c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">Talking to children about ICE raids is not just about explaining what’s happening — it’s about helping them navigate a world where fairness and justice are not always guaranteed. By addressing these issues with honesty, empathy, and a focus on action, parents can equip their children with the tools to understand, care, and make a difference. In doing so, we plant the seeds for a more compassionate and equitable future.</p></div></div></section><section name="e7e2" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="c67e" id="c67e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I shouldn’t have to had written this essay. The AI tells us why:</strong></p><p name="eb04" id="eb04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The necessity of writing such an essay reflects a profound societal failure to uphold the fundamental principles of justice, safety, and compassion. Here’s why this conversation is so deeply troubling and why you shouldn’t have had to write it:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="751d" id="751d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Violation of Safe Spaces</strong>: Schools, hospitals, and churches have long been seen as sanctuaries where people — especially children — can feel protected. These spaces symbolize the universal values of care, education, and spiritual refuge. ICE raids in these locations undermine those values, forcing children and families to live in fear even in places that should provide comfort.</li><li name="6242" id="6242" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Erosion of Norms</strong>: The reinstatement of policies permitting such raids marks a significant departure from established norms of decency and fairness. The fact that such actions are now sanctioned by the highest levels of government demonstrates how systems meant to protect individuals from harm can be manipulated or ignored.</li><li name="4e84" id="4e84" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Children Shouldn’t Bear This Burden</strong>: No child should have to grapple with the possibility of their friends or family being taken away while at school, receiving medical care, or attending a place of worship. The weight of this fear robs children of their innocence and sense of security, forcing them to confront issues far beyond their years.</li><li name="9ded" id="9ded" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Parents Are Left Alone to Explain Injustice</strong>: The burden falls on parents to contextualize and explain these policies, often without clear answers themselves. This essay exists because systems designed to protect individuals — checks and balances, community safeguards, and political accountability — have failed to prevent these injustices.</li><li name="ba17" id="ba17" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">A Broken Promise of Equality</strong>: The United States prides itself on ideals of freedom, equality, and opportunity. However, policies targeting immigrant families and violating sacred spaces reveal the gap between these ideals and the reality for marginalized communities.</li><li name="3cd5" id="3cd5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Fear as a Tool of Control</strong>: Policies that instill fear in vulnerable communities undermine trust in institutions, create divisions, and discourage people from accessing essential services like education and healthcare. These tactics are not only harmful but also morally indefensible.</li><li name="8975" id="8975" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Historical Parallels</strong>: The normalization of targeting specific groups recalls some of the darkest chapters in history. From internment camps to segregation, policies that dehumanize and persecute have consistently led to regret and calls for justice in hindsight.</li><li name="edda" id="edda" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">A Call to Action</strong>: This essay shouldn’t have to exist because the systems and communities that value justice and equity should have already taken action to prevent these situations. Writing this essay underscores the urgency of standing up against injustice and amplifying the voices of those affected.</li></ol><h3 name="3770" id="3770" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Why You Wrote This Essay</h3><p name="d59b" id="d59b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">You wrote this essay because you care about creating a world where children can grow up without fear, where families aren’t torn apart, and where fairness and empathy prevail. While this essay reflects the failures of systems and policies, it also serves as a testament to hope and the belief that education and dialogue can inspire change. It exists because we still have the power to make things better — and because we must.</p></div></div></section>
