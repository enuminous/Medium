A Federal Retaliation Story Unfolding in Woodland, California

Miller. For over a year, I have been working under her authority to catalog, research, and sell valuable family heirlooms, including rare stamps, coins, textiles, and international artifacts. Just last week, I uploaded a high-value Japanese kimono to her eBay store. We were actively and productively working together. There was no termination, no warning, and no instruction to cease operations.</p><p name="bc8a" id="bc8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We were also engaged in intellectual property discussions regarding her participation in my published scientific discoveries and ventures, including matters of royalties and strategic partnerships. Barbara had every intention to continue our partnership, and I had every reason to believe that we were operating on mutual respect and clarity.</p><p name="9031" id="9031" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then something happened.</p><p name="d537" id="d537" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Barbara was forced to witness a violent assault against me. This incident destabilized her. It is my belief—and supported by the pattern of prior events—that this event was designed to destabilize and isolate both of us. Following that moment, Barbara was abruptly removed from the home. She ceased communication. I have not heard from her directly since. Her only messages were out-of-character links to general mental health services—completely inappropriate given her knowledge of my existing mental health care through and our prior collaboration. The messages from her are confusing and evidence of control of her phone. I have had no contact directly from her since Thursday. Since she knew I was a federal Whistleblower, we had agreed to at least inform each other of our movements, and stay in touch. After the assault on me, she disappeared on Thursday, and I have not heard her voice since. This is the exact same thing that happens to my partner in Oroville.</p><p name="a501" id="a501" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is now confirmed that the Woodland Police Department consider her removed from the home under coercive circumstances, and possibly held against her will under the pretext of a psychiatric hold. The department is aware this is the second such person removed from my life in a similar fashion—Teresa being the first.</p><p name="0dd7" id="0dd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now, while Barbara is missing, I have just been served with a 30-day eviction notice—signed in her name, or on behalf of her, by someone operating under the very estate I was hired to protect and promote. This is a clear contradiction:</p><p name="5026" id="5026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have never been terminated, verbally or in writing.</p><p name="7e79" id="7e79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am still actively managing Barbara&#39;s eBay account with her prior consent.</p><p name="4860" id="4860" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have contributed direct revenue to the estate and was engaged in its continued operations at the time of the eviction.</p><p name="d8e9" id="d8e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The individual (Barbara) is not mentally present or capable of providing informed consent for this eviction.</p><p name="49e8" id="49e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her attorneys have made no effort to contact me, reassure me of her safety, or acknowledge the continuity of our business.</p><p name="6f49" id="6f49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let this be absolutely clear:</p><p name="0371" id="0371" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not a civil landlord-tenant issue. This is a coordinated act of federal whistleblower retaliation, one that includes:</p><p name="0635" id="0635" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The removal of a federal witness (Barbara) from my presence</p><p name="0c68" id="0c68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The nullification of a working business contract without cause</p><p name="b4a7" id="b4a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The active destruction of my ADA accommodations, including access to my medications and workspace</p><p name="3498" id="3498" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The use of mental health infrastructure to coerce and silence individuals who were directly aligned with me in truth-telling, business, and protection</p><p name="13b5" id="13b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Barbara Miller is a woman of substantial means, intelligence, and discernment. She is a witness to the validity of my work and the abuses I’ve endured. Her sudden mental health event, detachment, and weaponization by the estate against me is a red flag to everyone watching.</p><p name="dd0b" id="dd0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her rights are being violated. So are mine.</p><p name="7533" id="7533" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now call upon:</p><p name="39d1" id="39d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Woodland Police Department to investigate not just Barbara’s status, but who authorized this retaliatory eviction.</p><p name="2fe7" id="2fe7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The attorneys representing Barbara and the estate to account for how they are exploiting a mentally vulnerable client to sabotage a whistleblower relationship.</p><p name="8eaf" id="8eaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ADA, ACLU, Department of Justice, and all appropriate state and federal whistleblower protection units to recognize the pattern here—witness removal, mental health weaponization, and contractual sabotage.</p><p name="c133" id="c133" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just a story about antiques.<br>This is not just about housing.<br>This is the exact blueprint for how truth-tellers are erased in slow motion.</p><p name="fa44" id="fa44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this time, we’re writing it all down.</p><p name="1bc8" id="1bc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">now, for those asking if I’m going to stay past the 30 days, I have every right to be here until Barbara specifically tells me that I need to go, and in a way in which I am assured that she is not being controlled, coerced, manipulated or used depict me as mentally disturbed or incapable. As a matter of fact, I currently hold documents precluding any 5150 hold as medically unadvisable and injurious to my health, as I would be then vulnerable to further manipulation, and unable to continue my work in quantum physics. These obstructions and derailment attempts have already cost the world billions of dollars in potential invention and discovery that I have been unable to do because my time has been wasted by these people who wants to injure me and stop me from working. Their plan will not succeed, because my daughter has so many sisters, and they are all American citizens, and all in very good trouble as a result.</p><p name="f813" id="f813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Are you with us?</p><p name="6891" id="6891" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">#JusticeForBarbara<br>#FederalWhistleblowerProtection<br>#ADAviolations<br>#WoodlandCA<br>#WhistleblowerUnderAttack<br>#WhereIsBarbaraMiller</p></div></div></section>
